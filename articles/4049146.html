                Muslim men's feelings of humiliation and powerlessness are propelling some to reassert their 'masculinity' by exercising power over women.

The climate of surveillance and suspicion has impacted young men in myriad ways, from their self-worth and understanding of their faith, down 'to the smallest details' relating to their appearance, said Fatima*, the head of an Islamic organisation. Do they grow a beard? Do they anglicise their names and forgo traditional clothing? Men are making these decisions in an environment 'riddled with Islamophobia'.'
