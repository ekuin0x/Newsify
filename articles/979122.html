                Ed Sheeran has apologised to his fans after he was forced to cancel a concert at the last minute. The hitmaker, 32, was set to perform a huge show at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium on Saturday, but he pulled out less than two hours before he was due to take to the stage. Ed confirmed the show would be rescheduled until October and that original tickets would still be valid. He heartbreakingly took to his social media to share the news, insisting he was "so, so sorry".

It’s impossible to go forward with the show. I’m so sorry. I know everyone has travelled in for this and I wish I could change it. The gig will be postponed to Saturday October 28th and all purchased tickets will be valid for that date. I’m so, so sorry." According to the local paper, Review Journal fans were already at the venue queuing up when he cancelled the show. They reported: "After seeing the post, CJ Fuentes turned around and told everyone in line that the show had been cancelled. Fuentes’ announcement was how Steve Polevoi and his daughter, who were also in line, found out about the cancellation." Allegiant Stadium also published a statement. They said: "Updates were communicated as quickly as possible to those waiting outside and via our social channels, website, and venue app. Stadium doors were opened at 5:05 PM to get fans out of the heat and we have ensured that anyone requiring assistance has received it." Ed likes to give back to his fans and earlier on his US tour, he made a surprise appearance behind a till. He shocked fans by serving up some juicy hot dogs prior to his sell-out concert in Chicago. Ed headed to The Wiener's Circle hot dog stand to give away the company's delicacies to its overjoyed customers. The Perfect hitmaker was greeted by a large queue as the excited crowd hoped to be handed the wiener by their favourite singer. Taking to their Twitter page, the company joked: "Our newest trainee @edsheeran has a lot to learn, he's way too proper and friendly." The establishment is well known for its delicious food and cutting insults from staff. Sharing a clip of the experience to his Instagram , Ed said: "Served hot dogs at @wienerscircle today. This place is legendary is Chicago for serving hot dogs and insulting their customers. I loved it. See you at the stadium tonight x" While it's unknown why he made the appearance, fans were quick to praise the ginger star. One user commented on his post: "We need more people like Ed in this world," while another added: "I love your humble, modest body language."
