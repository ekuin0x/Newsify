                England hope to entice Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson away from Scots with 20-year-old still eligible for either nation Gareth Southgate is hoping that Elliot Anderson will play for England The 20-year-old Geordie has represented Scotland at various junior age groups He was handed his first senior Scotland call-up for last weeks Euro qualifier By Sami Mokbel For Mailonline Published: 22:38 BST, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 22:59 BST, 10 September 2023 e-mail View comments Gareth Southgate is interested in luring Newcastle midfielder Elliot Anderson into an international career with England. The 20-year-old Geordie has represented Scotland at various junior age groups, although he has played once for England Under 19s. He was handed his first senior Scotland call-up for last weeks Euro 2024 qualifier against Cyprus and Tuesdays prestige friendly against England  but pulled out of the squad through injury. Anderson, who was born in England but has a Scottish grandmother, is still eligible for either nation. And Southgate admits England are keeping tabs on the midfielder. We liked him and we do like him, we think hes a player thats doing really well, said the England boss. He was called into their (Scotlands) squad earlier in the week and I dont know what the position is at the moment. Gareth Southgate is interested in luring Elliot Anderson into a career with England 'I saw hes pulled out. Lets see, thats something that John (McDermott, FA technical director) and others at our organisation will be picking up. Hes definitely a player we like. However, Southgate has conceded that England have no chance of persuading Brighton striker Evan Ferguson to make the switch from Republic of Ireland. The 18-year-old needs just one more competitive cap for the Irish before he becomes ineligible for England under FIFA rules. Ferguson withdrew from the latest Republic squad, sparking suggestions that England were looking to pounce for the teenager. Anderson, who was born in England with a Scottish grandmother, is eligible for either nation But Southgate added: Hes made it clear he feels he was born in Ireland and hes represented them. Hes a bloody good player. We have to respect him, I dont think hes given any inkling that would be any different. At the same time, we were looking at (Erling) Haaland and wishing that he might have been available as well! But weve got a pretty good No 9 and were very happy with him.
