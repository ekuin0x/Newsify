However, some South Africans could not reach the live updates on the SABC Sport website as it had crashed. We are aware of the issues users wishing to follow the Rugby World Cup action are experiencing on our website, and have technicians attending to this.We apologise for the inconvenience, SABC Sport said on X, formerly known as Twitter. STREAMING SERVICE ALSO CRASHES The public broadcaster proceeded to direct viewers to its streaming service platform, SABC +, which also had technical clitches. SABC Plus just crashed just as we were singing the national anthem for the @Springboks. I wonder why no one cares about this failed corporation anymore. To SuperSport TV we go, an X user said. SABC AND MULTICHOICE DEAL The coporations broadcast issues were brought to light this week after its challenges to meet MultiChoices reported R38-million demand for the rights to show the Rugby World Cup matches. However, on Thursday, 7 September, the blackout was averted.

MultiChoice also said: Should the Springboks not qualify for the knockout stages, the above matches will, in any event, be available for broadcast.
