                A brand-new primary school in Oxfordshire has welcomed its first pupils. The construction of Graven Hill near was completed last week and is being managed by Warriner Multi-Academy Trust. It is the UKs biggest self-build development and occupies a three-acre site. The two-form entry school has a capacity for 420 pupils, but day one saw 13 reception children and 27 pre-school children attend. There are 12 classrooms, specialist facilities for art, design and technology and more than 13,000 square metres of pitches, play and multi-use games areas. Oliver Vistesens daughter Ayla was the first pupil to go through the school gates. He said she was "both excited and nervous at the same time". The school was funded by the Graven Hill development and constructed by Kier on behalf of Graven Hill Village Development Company (GHVDC) and Oxfordshire County Council. Adrian Unitt, operations director at GHVDC, said: We have overcome huge challenges in the UK construction industry, from significant inflation of costs to access to materials, so it is fantastic that we have succeeded in delivering the primary school prior to the occupation of the 550th home at Graven Hill. Designed to promote collaboration and flexible learning, the new school will enhance the great sense of community spirit here. With a focus on great architecture, the building has been designed to reduce energy and water consumption, enhance ecology, protect biodiversity and maximise natural ventilation.
