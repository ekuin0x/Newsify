                Harry Kane takes a swipe at Tottenham as he says 'it wasn't a disaster' if Spurs didn't win before hailing the 'top club mentality' at Bayern Munich and the pressure to dominate in the Bundesliga Tottenham legend Harry Kane joined Bayern Munich for £100m this summer The England star lauded his new club's 'top mentality' in comparison to Spurs Listen to the latest episode of Mail Sport's podcast It's All Kicking Off! By Ben Willcocks For Mailonline Published: 10:13, 9 September 2023 | Updated: 11:57, 9 September 2023 e-mail 102 View comments Harry Kane has lauded Bayern Munich 's 'top mentality' in a subtle dig at this old side Tottenham , claiming he has to win every match in Bavaria to keep up with the club's expectations. The Tottenham legend, who completed his £100million move to Bayern this summer , has enjoyed a fruitful start to life in Munich after scoring three goals in three league matches since his arrival. Kane, who is set to lead England out as captain against Ukraine on Saturday, reflected on his first month at the Bundesliga giants ahead of the Euro 2024 qualifier. 'We wanted to win at Spurs, but if you went a couple of games without winning it wasn't a disaster. At Bayern you have to win every game,' the 30-year-old forward said. 'After winning 3-1 and 4-0 in our first two games, there was talk about not being too happy about way we played! Top club mentality.' Harry Kane lauded Bayern Munich 's 'top mentality' in a subtle dig at this old side Tottenham The former Spurs forward claimed he has to win every match at German giants Bayern Munich Bayern Munich won their 11th successive Bundesliga title on the final day of the season in May Kane, who failed to win a single major trophy at Tottenham despite becoming the club's all-time top goalscorer, moved to Bayern in pursuit of more silverware. Bayern Munich have an astonishing domestic record in Germany, having won the Bundesliga for an 11th successive campaign on the final day of the season in May. Bayern suffered a disappointing 3-0 defeat by Red Bull Leipzig on Kane's debut, with the former Spurs star coming off the bench in the second half as Thomas Tuchel's side crashed out of the German Cup. Kane has since impressed in attack with a goal against Werder Bremen and two at home to Augsburg, taking his tally to three Bundesliga goals so far. Spurs, who failed to qualify for Europe after finishing eighth last season, have coped well after losing their star man this summer, climbing to second in the league behind Manchester City ahead of the international break. New signing James Maddison and star forward Son Heung-min have taken on the goalscoring responsibilities since Kane's exit, with the latter netting a hat-trick in a 5-2 win over Burnley last weekend.

Kane failed to win a major trophy during his time at Spurs, who lost the 2019 Champions League final to Liverpool The England captain is set to lead the Three Lions out against Ukraine on Saturday evening Speaking at Friday's press conference, Kane leapt to the defence of his Three Lions team-mate Jordan Henderson after it was reported that the ex-Liverpool captain would face a protest at Wembley following his controversial move to Saudi Arabia. Henderson, who vocally advocated LGBTQ+ rights during his time at Anfield, penned a £700,000-a-week deal this summer with Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia, where homosexuality is criminalised. Defending Henderson's decision to start a new chapter in his career, Kane said: 'Every England fan is entitled to their opinions, and what they want to do. Like Gareth (Southgate) said, the majority of England fans will be behind the team and once the game starts will be fully behind everyone. 'Jordan is a good friend and a great person. Everyone here knows how good a person he is. He has got a job to do here, as we all do and that's where his focus will be. Once we're on the pitch that is all we will think about.'
