                The Regional District of Central Okanagan doesnt anticipate any properties who have been placed under an evacuation order or alert will have their status changed on Sunday. 283 properties in the RDCO Electoral Area West, as well as 122 properties within the City of West Kelowna remain under an evacuation order. Areas that remain on Evacuation Order were hardest hit by the McDougall Creek Wildfire and are more remote, topographically challenging and/or close to active wildfire areas, the RDCO said in a release. No temporary accesses are being permitted today. 2:05 North Shuswap residents ask to be part of wildfire fighting efforts Restoration and recovery work has continued throughout the weekend, including 125 BC Hydro workers who have been tasked to replace approximately 27 kilometres of power lines, 426 poles and 66 pieces of other equipment. So far, more than 70 per cent of the work has been completed. Story continues below advertisement Among some of the other work being done to ensure evacuation orders can be rescinded and residents can return home safely include natural gas and water service restoration, danger tree assessments and removals, slope assessments and hazardous materials removals from public property and rights of way. According to BC Wildfire Service, the McDougall Creek wildfire, which forced thousands of Central Okanagan residents from their homes, remains to be out of control and is estimated to be 13,970.4 hectares. The slight size increase over the past several days is a result of planned ignition operations  something that wont be happening on Sunday as a result of warmer weather. Weather continues to be a factor in all attempts to bring the fire under control with unseasonably warm and continuing dry weather, BC Wildfire said in a release.
