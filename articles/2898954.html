                As his rivals hold town halls and meetandgreets in early voting states Donald Trump will head to South Dakota Friday for a party fundraiser that will double as an opportunity for the states governor Kristi Noem  to showcase herself as a potential vice presidential pick Trump will join the South Dakota Republican Party for a Monumental Leaders Rally in Rapid City Noem will appear alongside the former president and is expected to endorse him creating an image of the pair that Noems allies hope looks like a presidential ticket according to two senior Republicans familiar with her thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because she had not yet made her endorsement public Trumps decision to headline the event underscores his dominance of the Republican race even as he faces four separate indictments and 91 felony counts South Dakota holds a late primary and isnt competitive in a general election But with a huge lead Trump is skipping much of the traditional primary campaign Instead of largescale rallies he is relying on state party events that offer large friendly audiences at no cost to his campaign while his political organization pays millions of dollars in legal expenses Fridays event is something of an audition for Noem She planned the event as a way to both offer her endorsement and maximize face time with Trump as he eyes potential 2024 running mates and cabinet members according to one of the Republicans who spoke on anonymously A spokesman for the governor declined to comment Noem will be termlimited in 2026 and after declining to run for president this year is eyeing her next move to maintain prominence in the GOP I think Donald Trump has a 5050 shot of getting elected at this point so why not hitch your wagon to him if you can said Michael Card a longtime observer of South Dakota politics who suggested Noem might also make a future National Rifle Association president or conservative commentator Voting wont begin for several months and Trumps indictments and upcoming criminal trials create an unprecedented situation that many strategists argue could influence the race in unexpected ways That hasnt stopped those who are keen to be considered as Trumps running mate from openly jockeying for the position and trying to curry favor with him and his aides Aides caution it is far too early for serious discussions But Trump has indicated in conversations that he is interested in selecting a woman this time around Among the other names that have been floated New York Rep Elise Stefanik Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and Tennessee Sen Marsha Blackburn Florida Rep Byron Donalds and Sen Tim Scott have also been mentioned Trump will be in Iowa the first state on the GOP nomination calendar on Saturday to attend the college football game between Iowa and Iowa State What were focused on is just locking up this primary and pivoting towards the general election said campaign spokesman Steven Cheung Noem was long considered a potential White House contender in her own right and had told The New York Times in November that she didnt believe Trump offered the best chance for the party in 2024 She has since said she saw no point in joining the crowded field running for the nomination given Trumps dominant position I will tell you that of course I would consider it she told Fox News host Sean Hannity when asked recently about whether she would join a potential Trump ticket if asked If President Trump is going to be back in the White House Id do all I can to help him be successful It will be Trumps first visit to South Dakota since the summer of 2020 when he headlined a Fourth of July fireworks celebration at Mount Rushmore on the eve of Independence Day The thenpresident had been looking for a venue to turn the page after a summer of pandemic lockdowns and racial justice protests Noems event at Mount Rushmore was notably devoid of pandemic restrictions She also gifted him a miniature replica of Mount Rushmore with his likeness carved alongside George Washington Thomas Jefferson Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt I dont know exactly Trump said Thursday when asked if Noem will endorse him But I am going I like her a lot I think shes great Kristis done a great job He has often praised her handling of the pandemic saying again Thursday she had done a fantastic job A former member of Congress Noem in 2018 squeezed out a surprisingly close win over a Democratic challenger to become South Dakotas first female governor She rose to national prominence with a mostly handsoff approach to the pandemic and tacked closely to the urgings of Trump to return to life as normal She handily won reelection last year even as she performed worse than other Republicans on the ballot Despite not running for president Noem has continued to position herself nationally She has been an outspoken champion for the National Rifle Association even bragging at a spring convention for the gunrights group that her 1yearold granddaughter already has firearms She has also defended South Dakotas abortion ban and will appear at a Michigan fundraiser later this month to support Republican Senate candidate Mike Rogers During the first GOP presidential debate she appeared in an ad to encourage businesses and families to move to what she calls the freest state in America Fridays event is expected to draw protesters targeting both Trump and Noem said Annie Bachand CEO of the South Dakotabased group Liberty  Justice for All The reason that we show up is to demonstrate to other people that were not alone Bachand said Kristi Noem has spent more time out campaigning for I dont know what than she has in South Dakota She has more interest in her own selfinterest than she does in taking care of the people of South Dakota South Dakota GOP chair John Wiik said he expects about 7000 people to attend the soldout fundraiser The event was first planned as a Lincoln Daystyle fundraising dinner commonly held by local Republican groups Wiik said but it later ballooned into a rally with proceeds going to the state party I did get a lot of questions at first Wiik said about Trumps decision to travel to his state just as the primary season kicks into its traditional postLabor Day overdrive But the more you look at it Trump is a media event wherever he lands Wiik said He could do a rally on the moon and hed spread his word and get just as many people so Im just glad he chose South Dakota __ Colvin reported from New York
