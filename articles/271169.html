                First suspected sighting of Britains most wanted Newsagent claims fugitive Iranian spy jumped into getaway car two miles from prison as transport hubs on high alert  amid fears escape was an inside job The former British Army soldier escaped from HMP Wandsworth on Wednesday READ MORE Daniel Abed Khalife prison escape LIVE By Tom Pyman Published 1434 8 September 2023  Updated 1504 8 September 2023 email 1 View comments The first suspected sighting of Britains most wanted man has been made after a newsagent claimed he may have seen escaped terror suspect Daniel Khalife jump into a getaway car Fears that the former British Army soldiers escape from HMP Wandsworth was an inside job have grown today with Met Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley admitting it was a theory detectives were looking at It came explosive experts were called after a suspicious vehicle was stopped by police at the Channel Tunnel  where increased checks have been made following the jailbreak The incident is not thought to be linked to Khalifes escape however As police explore the possibility that the 21yearold was aided by prison staff reports of him having help on the outside too began to gather pace A shop assistant reported seeing a tall lanky dude with dark hair who he later recognised as Khalife from media images enter a black coloured vehicle outside Wandsworth Country Court This is roughly a twomile 10minute drive west of the Victorian jail where he escaped by strapping himself to the bottom of a delivery lorry after leaving the prison kitchen in a cooks uniform Daniel Khalife pictured a former soldier in the 22 Signal Regiment was on remand at HMP Wandsworth ahead of his sixweek terror trial A witness believes he saw Khalife enter a car near Market Putney Newsagents a 10minute drive from HMP Wandsworth where he escaped The eyewitness who was working at The Market  Putney Newsagents on Wednesday morning heard a commotion outside the store before seeing the man sprint across the street and get into a car on the other side of the road by traffic lights His manager told the Telegraph There was lots of beeping by cars and people were annoyed My friend one of the workers at the shop was in the shop on that morning at around 730 and he went outside where he saw a man running into a black car The man was some tall lanky dude with dark hair and there was a Bid food van READ MORE Fugitive Iranian spy Daniel Khalife The class joker at Keira Knightleys school who loved YouTubers and dreamed of being a cyberwarrior  and boasted to fellow prisoners that he was going to be famous   ad httpsmadsdailymailcoukv8gbnewsnonearticleothermpu_factboxhtmlidmpu_factbox_1   Advertisement My friend didnt see him getting out of the van but he saw him sprint across the street to the traffic lights The search for Khalife had earlier centred around Richmond Park which was locked down overnight amid claims he could be using his army training to hide out there Until just three years ago Khalife had lived in a 450000 twobed flat in Kingston on the outskirts of the park sharing a bedroom with his twin sister Two helicopters with bodyheat detecting technology circled above the park in the early hours before it was reopened to the public later this morning Meanwhile pharmacies have been urged to keep a lookout following suggestions he may have suffered burns to his face during his escape Khalife who served in 16 Signal Regiment whose motto is Find A Way Or Make One is thought to have clung to the underside of the truck by fashioning straps out of the plastic covering on his cell mattress Sir Mark told LBC of the escape this morning It is clearly preplanned the fact that he could strap himself onto the bottom of the wagon A police car is seen inside Richmond Park this morning as the hunt for Khalife continues He added a prison escape is unlikely to be something you do on the spur of the moment READ MORE Daniel Khalife lookalike handcuffed on train platform was treated to a seat in first class as an apology for the mixup   ad httpsmadsdailymailcoukv8gbnewsnonearticleothermpu_factboxhtmlidmpu_factbox_2   Advertisement Asked if police are looking into whether it was an inside job the commissioner said It is a question Did anyone inside the prison help him Other prisoners guard staff Was he helped by people outside the walls or was it simply all of his own creation He called it extremely concerning that Khalife is on the loose Asked whether he was surprised to learn that the terror suspect was in a Category B prison Sir Mark said it did seem odd on first inspection The commissioner said the hunt for Khalife is a massive operation involving well into three figures of officers as well as help from forces around the country and from the border force At the moment we are still really keen to get any reports from members of the public he added It came as police chiefs involved in the Richmond Park search apologised to locals for the disruption The National Police Air Service tweeted To dispel some rumours that have been circulating We were deployed to Richmond Park last night searching for escaped prisoner Daniel Khalife Due to the size and complexity of the park this took a protracted period of time Apologies for the noise READ MORE Who is Daniel Abed Khalife and what did he do as Metropolitan Police launch an urgent manhunt for the suspected terrorist who has escaped from HMP Wandsworth   ad httpsmadsdailymailcoukv8gbnewsnonearticleothermpu_factboxhtmlidmpu_factbox_3   Advertisement Meanwhile Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were questions about the link between government austerity and this man escaping He said Theres a question in relation to the medium and long term about the link between government austerity and this man escaping I know from my own experience as the member of parliament previously for Tooting where Wandsworth prison is there are big problems in relation to it being overcrowded and being a Victorian prison lack of investment lack of enough staff and those questions will need answering from the Government Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor said staff shortages at Wandsworth are the source of many problems and that in an ideal world the jail would be shut The prisons performance has been rated a serious concern and watchdogs issued a string of warnings about the jail in the year before the incident It comes as pharmacies have been urged to keep a lookout following suggestions that the exBritish Army soldier may have suffered burns to his face during his escape Police patrol Richmond Park southwest London this morning following the escape of Daniel Khalife The park was eerily quiet this morning as it reopened following a huge police search overnight There were very few vehicles driving through Richmond Park after it reopened to the public this morning A heavy police presence surrounding Richmond Park following the escape of Daniel Khalife CCTV footage has shown the van which Daniel Khalife clung to in his audacious escape just 200 yards from prison with no sign of the fugitive terror suspect underneath Former Scotland Yard detective Peter Bleksley told Sky News Clinging to the bottom of a vehicle if its got a petrol or diesel combustion engine it is a pretty risky thing to do not only because of course you can lose your grip and fall on a roadway but exhaust systems which generally speaking run the entire length of a vehicle like that get incredibly hot The slightest touch of that exhaust system will leave you with a vey unpleasant burn READ MORE I was an inmate with Daniel Khalife at HMP Wandsworth   ad httpsmadsdailymailcoukv8gbnewsnonearticleothermpu_factboxhtmlidmpu_factbox_4   Advertisement So I would suggest to anybody who works in a chemist or pharmacy or shops where medical supplies are sold  just keep your eyes out today if somebody comes in asking for advice on how to treat burns and sourcing bandages and the like Elsewhere CCTV footage today showed the van Khalife escaped under just 200 yards from the prison with no sign of the suspect Questions continue to grow over how the suspected terrorist who is alleged to have spied for Iran  was able to flee the Category B prison where there have long been concerns over security An inmate who worked with Khalife in the jail kitchen revealed how they used to joke about jumping in a delivery lorry and driving off And another former prisoner revealed how staff were so overstretched they even asked him to help lead the roll call of inmates on his wing Meanwhile a barrister and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation said today it was mindboggling that Khalife was able to work in a kitchen with access to knives Lord Carlisle told the BBCs Five Live It causes concern on why the perpetrator was in that prison whether he escaped solo or if there were state actors  possibly Iran The idea that someone was judged for spying for Iran and terrorism offences was able to work in a Category B prison in the kitchen with access to knives is mindboggling Jonathan Hall KC told Radio 4s World at One programme Mr Khalife has been charged with collecting information which might be useful to an enemy and that he should have been held in a higher security prison I would have thought someone charged with espionage should be held more securelyjust based on what the authorities knew They knew he was charged with an offence under the Official Secrets Act thats a very serious offence one would have thought that you would look at the advanced capabilities that might come with working for or having relations with a hostile state he said Mr Hall also warned against legislation to make all of those accused of terrorism to be placed in a category A prison Id be worried if there was a reaction which said now every person suspected of terrorism should be categorised as a high escape risk Fresh CCTV footage today shows the Bidfood lorry which Khalife used for his escape driving down a residential street just 200 yards from the jail READ MORE Police comb Richmond Park in hunt for fugitive terror suspect   ad httpsmadsdailymailcoukv8gbnewsnonearticleothermpu_factboxhtmlidmpu_factbox_5   Advertisement There is no sight of the fugitive in the images suggesting that he may have leapt off the vehicle immediately after it left the prison gates Scotland Yard revealed last night there was 65 minutes between it leaving the prison and being stopped and searched by police meaning a huge number of possible places where Khalife might have slipped away As investigators worked to unravel how he managed to pull off a Colditzstyle breakout in broad daylight more details emerged of the audacious escape Khalife who police suspect used his military training to carefully plan his escape began Wednesday morning by helping to prepare breakfast at the Victorian jail Them Met Police admitted that Khalifes previous military experience may make him harder to catch as he is likely more aware of efforts to apprehend him He turned up for duty dressed in his chefs uniform of a white Tshirt distinctive red and white chequered trousers and brown steeltoe boots How many other prisoners have escaped HMP Wandsworth and what is the jail like In 1965 Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs escaped with three others by scaling HMP Wandsworths 30ft perimeter wall after they were allowed out to exercise Prison guards obstructed by other inmates who were still exercising watched on helplessly during the daring prison break Biggs went on to be a fugitive for 36 years living in Australia and Brazil before flying back to the UK in 2001 and being put behind bars again In 2003 Eamon Donaghue ditched his prison clothes for a prison officers uniform he found while cleaning the officers mess hall Fraudster Neil Moore was on remand in the Category B prison when he managed to get out in 2015 by posting a letter to wardens pretending it was from the court service He told clueless wardens that he had been granted bail and was free to walk out He later had a change of heart and surrendered himself after three or four days And most recently in 2019 a prisoner was wrongly released by Wandsworth staff just six days into a sixweek sentence Wandsworth has seen at least six inmates break out over the years  including Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs HMP Wandsworth a Category B prison in southwest London is one of the UKs largest It was built in 1851 as the Surrey House of Correction In 2022 its wardens were heavily criticised in a damning report that claimed the prison was plagued by overcrowding and violence The report noted that prisoners were left in very poor conditions surrounded by piles of litter in dirty graffiti covered cells Until as recently as 1996 inmates were forced to clean up their own excrement every morning in a process call slopping out Notable current and former inmates include German tennis star Boris Becker Boxer and artist Charles Bronson David Chaytor the first MP to be convicted for his role in the parliamentary expenses scandal Drill artist Digga D Paedophiles Gary Glitter and Rolf Harris Wikileaks founder Julian Assange Gangster Ronnie Kray Great Train Robbery culprit Ronnie Biggs   ad httpsmadsdailymailcoukv8gbnewsnonearticleothermpu_factboxhtmlidmpu_factbox_6   Advertisement After serving breakfast to inmates and guards he slipped out of the kitchen carrying makeshift strapping of some kind which police have declined to describe in more detail In the yard outside the kitchen building a lorry from the wholesaler Bidfood was making a routine delivery of groceries When no one was looking Khalife ducked under the sidebars of the lorry and positioned himself precariously beneath the trucks underbelly using the strapping to support his weight At around 730am with the driver blissfully unaware of the stowaway the Bidfood lorry was driven 250 yards along the road running along the inside of the 30ft perimeter wall famously scaled by Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs in 1965 Two internal security gates had to be opened to let it pass At 732am the lorry carrying the former Royal Signals soldier rolled through the prisons imposing Victorian gate into the open It was waved past guards and CCTV cameras with another cursory inspection with no one thinking to check underneath at any of the three security checks As Khalife clung on just inches from the wheels and the spinning drive shaft the lorry turned right on to residential Heathfield Road then left then left again on to the busy triplelaned A214 Police have stressed there is no suspicion about Bidfood or its driver and said they had been cooperating fully Officers either do not know or have not said at what point Khalife decided to leave his escape vehicle or what he did next But the truck embarked on a near fourmile route through Wandsworth Town and on to the South Circular A205 road heading west towards Putney Khalife had an 18minute headstart before anyone even noticed his absence He was declared missing at 750am and prison officers launched an urgent search but it was a further 25 minutes before the police were called at 815am  by now a full 43 minutes after he had sprung himself Metropolitan Police cars descended on the area while the lorry driver was called by his company and ordered to turn around and return to the prison On a busy high street close to East Putney station officers swooped on the Bidfood truck at 837am outside a coffee shop A business owner who witnessed the operation told the Mail The police were searching inside the van underneath it on the roof in the cab everywhere At first there was one unmarked black police car then a van and about five police cars They were using two dogs to search it one inside and one underneath He said the search lasted for two hours Scotland Yard Commander Dominic Murphy said last night We searched it but we found no trace of him But we did find strapping that meant he had been underneath Officers were keeping an open mind as to whether Khalife was helped by accomplices but Mr Murphy cited the fugitives ingenuity and said We have some of the best military in world and he was a trained soldier He said police officers believed Khalife  a very resourceful individual  would have needed to plan his escape rather than it being opportunistic Police refused to confirm or deny if they had recovered potentially useful CCTV during their trawl but said there had been no sightings by members of the public despite it being a busy area of London It prompted speculation as to whether the fugitive could have arranged to be picked up by an accomplice in another vehicle Share or comment on this article First suspected sighting of Britains most wanted Newsagent claims fugitive Iranian spy jumped into getaway car two miles
