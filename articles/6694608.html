                Ariana Madix shows off her fit physique as she steps out in LA... after cheating ex Tom Sandoval is seen with rumored new flame Lika Osipova By Carly Johnson For Dailymail.com Published: 05:11 BST, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 08:53 BST, 10 September 2023 e-mail 25 shares 10 View comments Ariana Madix was spotted out in Los Angeles just hours after her cheating ex Tom Sandoval enjoyed a night on the town with his rumored new flame Lika Osipova. The Vanderpump Rules star, 38  who dated Tom for nearly a decade before finding out he'd had a months-long affair with her close friend Raquel Leviss  looked ultra fit in maroon workout gear on Saturday. She juggled a Starbucks cup, a plastic bag and her keys in her hands as she exited the driver's seat of her white luxury vehicle. Madix and the rest of the VPR cast recently wrapped shooting on the show's 11th season  the first since 'Scandoval' broke back in March. And now with more free time on his hands, Tom got the opportunity to spend a night out with Russian beauty queen Lika on Friday. Sporty: Ariana Madix, 38, was spotted out in Los Angeles on Saturday looking ultra fit in a maroon workout set The Ariana sighting came just hours after her cheating ex Tom Sandoval, 40, enjoyed a night out with his rumored new flame Lika Osipova The restaurateur, 40, joined the stunner for dinner at her restaurant/hookah lounge Bottega Taboo in West Hollywood. They rolled up to the high-class eatery in his shiny black Mercedes and dropped it off at the valet. Tom styled a white baseball cap with a white thermal top, black pants and white Converse sneakers. Meanwhile, Lika showed off her runway-worthy frame in a skintight Fendi jumpsuit and sky-high heels. Her blonde tresses were worn in glamorous curls that were swept over one shoulder. She sported her typical full glam makeup and carried her essentials in a black designer purse. After dining, Tom and Lika were photographed exiting Bottega Taboo together. Once his car returned to the valet, the TomTom co-owner looked like the ultimate gentleman as he opened the front passenger's side door for Lika. He first sparked romance rumors with Lika after she posted a photo of the pair looking cozy during the filming of the Vanderpump Rules season 11 finale in San Francisco last week. She tagged Tom as well as the official Vanderpump Rules Instagram page in the caption of her post. Date night: Tom, 40, joined Lika for dinner at her restaurant/hookah lounge Bottega Taboo in West Hollywood They rolled up to the high-class eatery in his shiny black Mercedes and dropped it off at the valet Style: Tom styled a white baseball cap with a white thermal top, black pants and white Converse sneakers In the photo, a tuxedo-clad Tom had his arm wrapped around Lika's tiny waist as she showed a lot of leg in a sexy black gown. Though the status of Tom's relationship with Lika has yet to be confirmed, Ariana has since moved on with hunky fitness coach, Daniel Wai. The pair have been romantically linked since April when they were seen packing in the PDA during the Coachella music festival in California. Most recently, she was spotted planting a kiss on her boyfriend as they attended a pre-party for Beyonce's Renaissance tour in Culver City last weekend. Wai was also on the VPR cast trip to San Francisco, along with Lala Kent, Scheana Shay, Katie Maloney, James Kennedy and Tom Schwartz  though it's unknown if he had an awkward run-in with Ariana's former partner. While appearing the Scheananigans with Scheana Shay, last month, Ariana gushed over Wai as she described him as having 'a very grounding, calming, positive energy.' 'He's very like, always trying to help with things,' she gushed to Shay. The bombshell went on to rave about how he likes to help her with mundane tasks, like calling her credit card company. As for their future together, Madix said she is going to continue to do what makes her 'happy and going in that direction.' Fashionista: Meanwhile, Lika showed off her runway-worthy frame in a skintight Fendi jumpsuit and sky-high heels On the go: After dining, Tom and Lika were photographed exiting Bottega Taboo together Smitten? Tom was caught gawking at Lika while they waited at the valet for his car Gentleman: Once his car pulled up, the TomTom co-owner opened the front passenger's side door for Lika He carefully closed the door behind her after she got settled in her seat 'He is someone who does bring a whole lot of happiness,' she continued, which prompted Shay, 38, to say she is 'obsessed' with Wai. Shay went on to say how unlike her pal's 'past relationships' that this one brings out 'the best' in Madix. 'You're with someone for the first time  that I've personally ever seen  who supports you, who's happy to help you and empower you and also take a backseat and just f**king let you shine,' Shay praised. During the interview, Madix also spoke about STILL living with Sandoval, five months after the messy end to their nine-year relationship. While navigating the end of their nine-year relationship, following his affair with her friend, Raquel Leviss, the former couple have continued to reside at the Los Angeles home that they purchased for $2 million in 2019. Despite Bethenny Frankel recently criticizing their awkward living arrangement on her Just B podcast, the reality star stated that she will not 'f**k [herself] over' by making any rash decisions. 'I have never been someone who came from money. I know how quickly that goes away,' she explained. 'I'm taking care of myself.' The performer went to on to say that she is 'not rich' and has a mortgage and other expenses. 'A lot of people on the internet seem to think I'm rolling in money right now. I have a lot of places where that money has to go before I get [it],' she continued. Despite living with Sandoval, the actress made it clear that she keeps their interactions to a minimum. Sparks flying: He first sparked romance rumors with Lika after she posted a photo of the pair looking cozy during the filming of the Vanderpump Rules season 11 finale in San Francisco last week 'Scandoval': Ariana split from Tom earlier this year after nine years together after it was discovered he'd been in a months-long affair with Raquel Leviss; Tom and Ariana seen in 2022 Quiet life: On Saturday, Raquel  who did not return for season 11  enjoyed a day at a 'flower farm' in Arizona 'I have a pretty decent setup,' she said. 'My room is kind of like my little apartment I stay in my own little zone.' Additionally, Madix said she keeps her door 'locked just in case' and sleeps 'easier at night not giving a f**k when he comes in that door.' 'Yes, we're in the same house, but I don't have to think about [him],' the former bartender told listeners. The Buying Back My Daughter star also explained why she has not moved in the comment section of one of her recent Instagram posts. 'I live in my home that I own while working with my lawyer and financial advisors to navigate the best path forward before uprooting my dog and my elderly cat and causing more trauma for the three of us,' she told a follower.
