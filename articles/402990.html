                Fears 3,000 jobs could go at Port Talbot steelworks despite 500m 'rescue' package from taxpayers By James Tapsfield, Political Editor For Mailonline Published: 11:52 BST, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 15:44 BST, 15 September 2023 e-mail 96 View comments Taxpayers are to pump up to 500million into Britain's biggest steelworks - but thousands of jobs still face being axed. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns the Port Talbot site, will use the funding to help switch the plant's two coal-fired blast furnaces to 'greener' electric arc versions. However, the company is also warning that the plans will lead to consultations over a 'deep potential restructuring' - with 3,000 out of the 8,000-strong workforce set to go. The 1.25billion furnaces are expected to be up and running within three years of getting regulatory and planning approvals. Tata sounded the alarm last year that its UK operations were under threat unless it secured Government support to help it move to less carbon-intensive electric arc furnaces. The existing furnaces are approaching the end of their life, but the replacements will require few people to run. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns the Port Talbot site, will use the funding to help switch the plant's two coal-fired blast furnaces to 'greener' electric arc versions Announcing the funding, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch said: 'The UK Government is backing our steel sector.' The grant is one of the largest government support packages in history, with ministers saying the switch to electric furnaces will reduce the UK's carbon emissions by 1.5 per cent. Rishi Sunak tried to reassure workers affected, saying there would be money to help them find new roles. 'The Government has been engaged in dialogue with Tata for a long time to see if there's a way for the Government to support Tata Steel to secure the future of steelmaking in South Wales and further the transition to green steelmaking, which is obviously necessary, as well,' he said. 'There were fears that around 8,000 jobs could be lost if steelmaking was lost at that plant. That clearly was a risk because those two blast furnaces there are reaching the end of their life. 'I'm pleased that the Government has managed to reach an agreement with Tata to support them in that transition, but they will also be making a very substantial capital investment into the plant to secure thousands of jobs. 'Obviously, there will still be some people affected and I know this will be an anxious time for them.' Announcing the funding, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch said: 'The UK Government is backing our steel sector, and this proposal will secure a sustainable future for Welsh steel and is expected to save thousands of jobs in the long term. 'This is an historic package of support from the UK Government and will not only protect skilled jobs in Wales but also grow the UK economy, boost growth and help ensure a successful UK steel industry.' Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: 'This proposal is a landmark moment for maintaining ongoing UK steel production - supporting sustainable economic growth, cutting emissions, and creating green jobs. 'It is right that we are ready to step in to protect this world class manufacturing industry and to support a green growth hub in South Wales.' Rishi Sunak tried to reassure workers affected, saying there would be money to help them find new roles But shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: 'Only the Tories could spend 500m of taxpayers' money to make thousands of British workers redundant. 'Britain needs an Industrial Strategy that invests alongside industry delivering a return on taxpayers' investment whilst protecting our national capabilities and workforce... 'Labour have pledged 3billion for investment alongside industry to decarbonise steel in partnership with workers and industry investing in a range of technologies to ensure we have the clean steel we need to rebuild Britain.' Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: 'These plans are disgraceful, short sighted and lack ambition. Steel is a foundation industry and the opportunity is being missed to make the UK a world leader in steel production. 'Unite will be fighting tooth and nail not only to save these jobs but to create more jobs in steel.'
