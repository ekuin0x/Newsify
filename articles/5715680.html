                Shylah Rodden rollercoaster accident shock - as Royal Melbourne Show where collision happened throws open the gates once more Shylah Rodden, 26, was hit by a rollercoaster Ms Rodden was 'horrifically' injured in the crash Offending rollercoaster ride opened just days later It's coming back this year for $15 per ride READ: Rollercoaster victim's family slam 'shameful' decision to re-open the ride By Wayne Flower, Melbourne Correspondent Published: 16:35, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 16:52, 15 September 2023 e-mail View comments EXCLUSIVE The rollercoaster that struck Shylah Rodden almost a year ago will return to the Melbourne Royal Show despite an ongoing investigation into its operators. The 27-year-old was struck by the Rebel Rollercoaster at full speed at last year's event in an incident that attracted worldwide attention after video appeared online. Shylah was flung nine metres into the air by the fast-moving ride after she tried to retrieve a dropped phone on September 24. She faces years of rehabilitation after suffering a massive brain injury. Shylah Rodden's life was destroyed when she was struck by the Rebel Rollercoaster at last year's Melbourne Royal Show Horrifying footage showed Shylah Rodden (pictured in black) moments before being hit by the Rebel Coaster at the Melbourne Royal show on September 24 Daily Mail Australia can reveal 2023 showgoers will be charged $15 to ride the rollercoaster, which boasts 'dips, loops, sharp bends & lots of thrills'. The ride's operators could still be charged by the safety watchdog, which has remained tight-lipped over the past year. A spokesperson for WorkSafe simply told Daily Mail Australia this week that its investigation remained 'ongoing'. However, it is understood a dedicated team of inspectors and engineers will inspect every ride operating at this years event before the gates open. A spokesperson for Melbourne Royal Show told Daily Mail Australia on Friday organisers had installed additional CCTV cameras across the event site, particularly in the carnival precinct to provide greater coverage and better footage of activity on rides. 'We once again extend our sympathy to Shylah and her family following the incident at the 2022 show. We also extend our thoughts to the bystanders who witnessed the incident,' the spokesperson said via a statement. Organisers reiterated the Rebel Coaster and all other rides at the show are independently owned and operated. 'We have continued to work with ride operators, WorkSafe, independent engineers and authorities to review the safety and operations of all rides on site to ensure they are safe prior to them being opened to the public,' the spokesperson said. The Melbourne Royal Show is set to open its gates on September 21 and run until October 1. Shylah Rodden's long fight News of the rollercoaster's inclusion at the event will come as little surprise to Shylah's long suffering family. Shylah's loved ones have largely shunned the spotlight over the past year after coming under fire from heartless trolls who blamed her for her own tragic fate. They had slammed show organisers for reopening the ride just days after the incident. It had been given the green light after a WorkSafe inspection concluded that it was 'safe'. A Melbourne Royal Show spokeswoman claimed 'the safety and well-being of our visitors to the show continues to be our number one priority' (pictured, the Royal Melbourne Show) Shylah's sister Caisha Rodden, who had been at bedside vigil alongside worried family members, described her family's disgust at the time in one word. 'Shameful,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Caisha did not respond to questions this week. Word on her sister's recovery remains a mystery. How Shylah Rodden incident unfolded On the day she was struck by the rollercoaster, Shylah had been working at a friend's stall at the Melbourne Royal Show. The pair had been on a break when they decided to go on a few rides to kill time. It is understood Shylah dropped her phone while on the rollercoaster and police believe she walked onto the tracks of the high-speed ride to retrieve the device. Shocking footage released via a tasteless TikTok video showed the moment of impact. Government sources told Daily Mail Australia shortly after the incident that whatever drove Shylah to jump onto the tracks was not a concern of the safety watchdog. It is understood WorkSafe's investigating is largely focused on what the ride's operators were doing when Shylah made her way onto the tracks. 'Her toxicity levels are not relevant to the investigation into whether the duty holder was doing everything reasonably practicable to provide a safe and healthy workplace,' a source told Daily Mail Australia last year. Questions over the height of fences around the ride (pictured) remain unanswered by Show management A passenger on the ride can be seen jumping off it with her handbag A Melbourne Royal Show spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia at the time that WorkSafe had declared the ride was safe to be re-opened. 'The safety and well-being of our visitors to the show continues to be our number one priority,' she said in a statement then. 'Strict safety protocols are upheld in line with Victorian WorkSafe regulations. All rides on site have undergone stringent compliance inspections and have passed all the required safety documentation.' Daily Mail Australia asked organisers then to reveal what, if any, new procedures, requirements or improvement notices the safety watchdog issued. Show management declined to answer. Safety inspectors are likely to show a keen interest in the rollercoaster at this year's event. Spot checks on rides can be carried out by inspectors during the show at any moment. Inspections assess factors such as safety systems, wear and tear, maintenance history and whether or not ride operators or attendants have been properly trained. Shylah ROdden's condition remains unknown a year after she was struck by a rollercoaster Video obtained by Daily Mail Australia last year showed passengers clearly hanging onto their possessions while riding the rollercoaster, which travels completely upside down. Access to the tracks also appeared to be restricted by a short fence. Shylah spent weeks in a coma and many more months at the Royal Melbourne Hospital before her release in January. Arnold Thomas & Becker, lawyers for Ms Rodden, confirmed at the time she had been moved from hospital to another health care facility. A spokesperson from the law firm said: 'Whilst this indicates that her condition has stabilised, the injuries she has sustained remain life-changing.' Shylah Rodden is on the road to recovery after being thrown nine metres into the air when she was struck by a rollercoaster at the Royal Melbourne Show Shylah Rodden's (pictured) sister said she had a long road ahead of her in regards to recovery and was still unable to communicate with loved ones Shylah's father Alan Rodden told Daily Mail Australia soon after the incident that his daughter had suffered life-changing injuries. 'I can't talk to my daughter. She's going to be in a coma for quite a while,' he said. 'The injuries are horrific. Horrific. She's brain damaged. It's pelvic, her arms, legs, back, neck - there's hardly a thing that's not broken. I just can't work out how the hell so much damage has been done. 'Even the doctors have said they haven't seen anything as bad as this for a long time.' A GoFundMe fundraiser established to help with Shylah's recovery raised just $36,483 before it was closed down - a fraction of the millions it will likely take to ensure she leads a comfortable life. Police revealed the rollercoaster was travelling at 70km/h when she was hit. Fairground veteran Brendan Mogler was so badly shaken by the memory of the accident he quit the carnival business after a lifetime of working on rides. Mr Mogler said those who witnessed the accident - and had had to deal with its devastating aftermath - had their lives severely impacted by it. 'What about the emotional damage (done) to all of us staff that were working on the roller coaster that day?' the distressed father posted on Facebook on Monday. 'After working on rides and coasters for the past 20 years, I will never work another ride again.' Members of the public who have a concern about the safety of an amusement ride should report it to WorkSafe's advisory service on 1800 136 089.
