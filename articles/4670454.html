                The Colorado Republican Party is hoping to join the fight against former President Donald Trump off the states ballot next year. The state GOP has fundraised off the case and is seeking to intervene in the legal proceeding  which was just sent back to Denver District Court this week by a federal judge after Trumps attempt to move it failed. The case itself grapples with whether Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is eligible to appear on Colorados primary and general election ballots in 2024 under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The petitioners  six Republican and unaffiliated Colorado voters  cite the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and allege Trump incited, exacerbated, and otherwise engaged it. The Civil War-era amendment prohibits people from holding office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the country. The lawsuit, the first well-funded attempt to disqualify Trump from a states ballot, is being led by local attorneys and the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. In a recent filing, the Colorado GOPs attorneys argued the partys purpose in seeking to intervene on Trumps side is to protect the access of its members, statewide, to as many candidates as possible. Nominating and designating candidates is its core role  regardless of who any particular candidate might be. The state party hired attorneys associated with the . The group is led by Jay Sekulow, who spearheaded in his first impeachment trial in 2020. The voters involved in the case argue their interests as Republican primary voters would be harmed if a person later found to be ineligible for the ballot was included on it because that person potentially could siphon votes from other candidates. Colorado Republican Party Chair Dave Williams has promised a vigorous defense against an effort hes called election interference, pure and simple. He is pursuing plans that include trying to ditch the 2024 Republican primary vote altogether, in favor of selecting national delegates through the party caucus process, if the ballot-challenge lawsuit results in Trump being barred from appearing. Please know we are doing everything in our power to ensure Colorado Republican voters can cast their vote for President Trump, or whoever else they choose, on the March 5th, 2024, Super Tuesday Presidential Primary, Williams wrote in a fundraising email Wednesday morning. The lawsuit, last week, has bounced between state and federal courts before landing back where it started. The state GOP had filed its intent to intervene in the case in federal court, and Williams signaled it will continue to pursue the request. Trumps legal team, which includes Republican former Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler, made the initial request to move the case to the U.S. District Court for Colorado because it invokes a Constitutional issue. Trumps team agreed to move the case back to state court after the petitioners warned they do not have standing for federal court. In federal court, the voters serving as plaintiffs would need to demonstrate an actual injury has happened in order to pursue a claim. But the plaintiffs maintain they have standing to sue in state court under Colorado law. Complicating matters is Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswolds position as a co-defendant. The Democrat, named in her official capacity because her office supervises elections, did not agree to move the case to federal court  which itself made the move defective, U.S. District Judge Philip Brimmer wrote in a filing.
