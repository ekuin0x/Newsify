                Have we reached an immigration tipping point in Canada Figures released by Statistics Canada on Friday definitely point in that direction In releasing the latest employment figures StatsCan said we are bringing in people faster than we are creating jobs Employment rose by 40000 02 in August This increase in employment was outpaced by population growth 103000 03 and the employment rate  the proportion of the population aged 15 and older who are employedfell 01 percentage points to 619 the report said  That figure of 103000 in a month is only the working age population of people 15 and older It doesnt include young children Still bringing in 103000 in a month is the equivalent of adding Pickering in Ontario Lethbridge in Alberta or Kamloops in British Columbia Since the beginning of the year StatsCan says we have averaged 81000 newcomers aged 15 and older per month That will equate to just over one million new people this year if the trend continues Given this pace of population growth employment growth of approximately 50000 per month is required for the employment rate to remain constant the report said This level of growth is double what Canada was experiencing between 20172019 and before the pandemic effectively closed borders So can we create 50000 jobs per month so that employment keeps pace with immigration In the last 12 months weve been over the 50000 jobs mark four times lost jobs in two of those months and for the other six didnt hit the mark If we continue to bringin in an average of 81000 working aged people per month but dont create at least 50000 new jobs then the unemployment rate will go up A report from StatsCan issued on August 1 looked at this issue of immigration and employment and found that for the most part employment has kept up with immigration That was before this latest increase though and with each increase it becomes more difficult to manage Over the last several years we have gone from bringing in between 250000 to 300000 new permanent residents each year  people who are immigrating to settle here  to more than 430000 permanent residents in 2022 The governments goal is to lift that to 500000 new permanent residents a year by 2025 a mark they will easily hit We have gone from a few hundred thousand international students studying in Canada each year to more than 800000 last year and estimates of more than 900000 this year None of this takes into account the thousands of people claiming asylum in Canada each month or the hundreds of thousands of temporary foreign workers A recent CIBC report suggested that Canadas population count could be off by one million thanks to an undercounting of nonpermanent residents mostly temporary foreign workers We have a housing crisis driven by more demand than supply and the everincreasing population especially among foreign students is adding to that This week we saw a story of international students in North Bay living in tents because of the lack of housing options available For the most part Canadians have been supportive of high levels of immigration All the major political parties have supported policies of increased immigration The current levels though unprecedented in our lifetime could change all of that and result in calls to slow things down We dont have enough housing for the people already in the country never mind adding a new city per month but we are also told we need the new arrivals to fill the jobs to build the houses Our health care system is regularly at a tipping point without enough doctors and nurses to deal with the population already here but we are also told that we need newcomers to fill the jobs in health care Yet when they get here we wont have proper housing health care education for their children or infrastructure for the communities they settle in It is quite a conundrum Is any of this good for the country or good for the people who are coming here quite possibly on the false notion that Canada is a country that still functions properly Perhaps now is a time to hit pause perhaps slow the intake until we have a handle on the situation and are sure we can absorb this many people so quickly
