Jim McSorley, Bothwell, added: I can't see Georgia managing to get the draw against Norway which would confirm Scotlands qualification on Tuesday but that's academic as Scotland have more than enough points to book flights to the Euros - and not just for the group games<br>-  Michael Beale is fighting a losing battle at Rangers this season (Image: Getty Images) Read More Related Articles Michael Beale at risk of his Rangers fantasy coming true as Rodgers joke becomes rivals' reality  Hugh Keevins Read More Related Articles The Rangers storm of 1994 remembered and the lesson Beale and struggling stars must heed This Scotland team has shown more than enough to be history makers and get us through to the knockout stages for the first time! Colin Gardner emailed in: Another magnificent performance by Scotland and a great result<br>-  With our 100 percent record, we have an excellent chance of automatic qualification<br>-  Well done, you made a nation proud! Scott McTominay cant get a game for Manchester United but hes Scotlands main man with six goals in Euro qualifying already<br>-  Tim Gibbens said: Old Trafford boss Erik Ten Hag really must need to go to Specsavers if he cant see that Scott McTominay is a player! Our number 4s like a tartan Rolls Royce these days! England are next up at Hampden on Tuesday in a match to mark the 150th anniversary of the two nations very first showdown back in 1872<br>-  Gary Stevenson, Newtonhill, said: Let's hope that the Scotland fans can behave at Hampden against England<br>-  I hope that they start by respecting the National Anthems and I remind them a lot of their own players are English<br>-  The international break hasnt all been good news for the Celtic support after Liel Abada picked up a knock while away on Israel duty<br>-  David Bryce, Troon, raged: The injuries Celtic have had at the start of the season have been nothing short of disgraceful! Questions have to be asked in relation to training strategies! If Abada is out for a month after doing extra training with the national team he should be fined by the club<br>-  When will these guys realise that they are obligated to the club? I hope Yang comes in, performs and keeps him out of the side! Across the city, the fall-out from Rangers derby defeat continues<br>-  Jimmy Mac, Glasgow, had some suggestions for under-fire boss Michael Beale: As a Rangers supporter I think we should consider an attacking option of Kemar Roofe and Danilo with Todd Cantwell given the freedom to be creative<br>-  As far as I recollect Beale has never used Roofe and Danilo as attack force from the start<br>-  Is Beale attempting to get Cyriel Dessers to play like Morelos? If so, it has failed miserably<br>-  Sam Lammers is lacking in confidence and tries too hard, Abdallah Sima is hot and cold and both he and Lammers need to relax and just play their own game<br>-  Rabbi Matondo has possibilities to be the winger we need<br>-  The coaching and tempo needs to go up a couple of levels with a lot more quick one touch play<br>-  Story Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks<br>-  Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right<br>-  Follow Daily Record Facebook Twitter Comment More On Scotland football team Steve Clarke Scott McTominay England football team Michael Beale Rangers FC Celtic FC
