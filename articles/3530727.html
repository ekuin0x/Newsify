                Gavin Bazunu 6 - Had no option but to take Dumfries down. Got fingers to Gakpos penalty and saved well to deny Simons. Matt Doherty 5 - Contributed to attacks but his stray header in midfield allowed Gakpo play Dumfries in for the penalty. Nathan Collins 6 - Crucial headed clearance to deny unmarked Ake at the back post and put in a solid shift. Shane Duffy 6 - A threat in the Dutch box at set pieces but was too deep when playing Dumfries onside for the Holland penalty. John Egan 5 - Quite the effort to play two games in four days after shipping an injury last week but subbed when Ireland went behind James McClean 6 - His corners were on the money and Ireland won their penalty from one of them. Spent and subbed. Alan Browne 7 - His tenacity in the press was a valuable asset and he saved a certain goal when blocking Simons in the box Josh Cullen 5 - Threatened early on with a volleyed shot but his lack of penetrating passes forward was frustrating. Jason Knight 8 - Has incredible energy and never stopped working here and scooped the man of the match award. Adam Idah 7 - Scored the early penalty and was a real handful for Van Dijk. Dropped deep to help out in a good performance. Chiedozie Ogbene 6 - Outlet for long balls and might have done better with a couple of shots but took too much out of them. IRELAND SUBS: Ryan Manning for McClean (64 mins) - 6 Jamie McGrath for Egan (73 mins) - 6 Will Smallbone for Browne (73 mins ) - 6 Sinclair Armstrong for Knight (87 mins) - 6 Festy Ebosele for Doherty (87 mins) - 5 HOLLAND: Flekken; De Ligt, Van Dijk, Ak; Dumfries, Wieffer (Reijnders 45), F. de Jong, Blind (Weghorst 45); Simons (Berghuis 89), Malen (Koopmeiners 68), Gakpo (Lang 81) Referee: I Peljto (Bosnia) Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts .
