The champion said he thought of the idea of making the t-shirt in case he won but didnt share it with anyone until he asked for help in making it happen. Kobe was close, close friend, we chatted a lot about, about the winners mentality when I was struggling with an injury and trying to make my comeback  work my way back to the top of the game, he said. He was one of the people that I rely on the most. He was always there for any kind of counsel advice, any kind of support in the most friendly way. He continued, What happened few years ago and him and his daughter passing hurt me deeply and I thought, 24 is the jersey that he wore when he became a legend of Lakers and world basketball. So I thought it could be a nice symbolic thing to acknowledge him for all the things hes done.
