                New Delhi: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Sunday hinted that Italy is planning to exit the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as Silk Road, while asserting that the move will not compromise relations with China, but the decision still has to be taken, ANI reported citing the Italian media, Corriere della Sera. The Italian PM met Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of the G20 Summit and shared her plan to pull out of the BRI, as per the Italian media report. While addressing the press conference on the last day of the G20 Summit, Meloni turned to talk about the conversation she had with the head of the Chinese government. "A cordial and constructive dialogue on how we can deepen our bilateral partnership... I intend to keep my commitment to visit China... It makes more sense to go to China when we have more information on our bilateral cooperation and how to develop it," Meloni said at the conference. "Leaving the Silk Road does not compromise relations, but the decision still has to be taken," the prime minister assured. She added, "The Italian government was invited to the Belt and Road Forum, but yesterday we didn't talk about it," with the Chinese prime minister. The Italian PM, who arrived in India on Friday to attend the G20 Summit, also held a bilateral meeting with her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G20 Summit. The two leaders noted with satisfaction the completion of 75 years of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. They also took stock of the progress in diverse areas of the India-Italy Strategic Partnership and agreed to bolster cooperation in areas like defence and new and emerging technologies.
