                Oxfords MPs have welcomed BMWs investment of 600 million at the Cowley plant with the aim to an all-electric production by 2030. Oxford East MP Anneliese Dodds alongside Oxford West and MP Ms Moran have expressed their delight at the news that Oxfords Mini plant in Cowley will build the new all electric Mini models. From 2026, the three door Mini Cooper and compact crossover Mini Aceman will be manufactured at the site. Ms Dodds struck a positive tone and said it was now beyond doubt that the electric Minis future is in Cowley- the home of the iconic Mini. She said: Today represents the culmination of years of hard work by those at the Cowley plant and is a vote of confidence in our local workforce. Ms Moran welcomed fantastic news for Oxfordshire. She said: Manufacturing of the Mini began in in 1959, and I am incredibly pleased that the production of electric vehicles will remain here, hopefully long into the future. However, Ms Moran also used the announcement as an opportunity to attack the government for leaving businesses in limbo. She said: The governments response to supporting car manufacturing has been sorely lacking. They have failed to produce any coherent industrial strategy and refused to align on EU tariffs which is generating headache after headache for businesses. Ms Moran said the government needed to stop haphazardly lurching from pillar to post and she called for a government which has a clear vision for the UK economy.
