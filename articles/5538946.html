                A man who stepped in to help with entertainment at a child's birthday after the hosts were let down at the last minute regretted his decision after he uncovered a scandalous affair . What made the situation worse was the fact that it was between his wife and his own brother. Details of the scenario have left people shocked as the man explained the ultimate betrayal further. The man, Jake, agreed to dress up as a clown at a birthday party. This came after his brother, who was originally supposed to wear the costume, told the hosts he was feeling too ill to do it. However, in return for the kind favour, Jake unfortunately discovered his now ex-wife was having an affair with his brother - and the truth all came to a head during the birthday party. Subtle sign of low sperm count that 90% of Brits don't know about MailOnline reports Jake called into Australian hosts Carrie and Tommy's radio show to reveal all about his scandalous tale and what he had to say left the hosts and listeners in shock. The first indication something was off was when Jake's now ex-wife started "touching and groping" him while he was dressed as the character thinking it was his brother, exposing their affair. Jake's ex-wife had no option but to confess, leaving Jake to confront his brother and family who, shockingly, all admitted they already knew what was going on behind his back. Speaking on the radio phone-in, Jake said: "She came up to me and started touching me and groping me and saying my brother's name and when I pulled off the face mask her jaw just dropped. She was like, 'It's not your brother' and I'm like, 'No it's not'." Jake went on to explain how he stormed out of the party, leaving his wife chasing after him before confessing to the whole affair, detailing when it started. Viewers of the radio show were naturally quick to offer sympathy to Jake while some even told him to "abandon" all his family for not telling him the truth sooner. One person said: "Yuck, that is so wrong" and another agreed: "Omg that's horrible". A third said: "The fact the family knew is probably worse." And, a fourth person said: "I'd abandon every one of them". What do you think? Let us know in the comments Michelle Keegan's 'beautiful' 13 high street dress is perfect for the heatwave
