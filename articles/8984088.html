                NEW YORK  Ottawa's Gabriela Dabrowski claimed her first Grand Slam title in women's doubles Sunday when she and partner Erin Routliffe won the U.S. Open final in straight sets. Dabrowski and Routliffe defeated Laura Siegemund of Germany and Vera Zvonareva of Russia 7-6 (11-9), 6-3 at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Dabrowski became Canadas first Grand Slam champion since Bianca Andreescu won the U.S. Open women's singles title in 2019. Dabrowski had previously won mixed doubles crowns at the Australian Open in 2018 and the French Open in 2017. The 31-year-old Canadian can now claim the U.S. Open among her Grand Slam collection, but this time in women's doubles. Routliffe was born in New Zealand, but grew up in Caledon, Ont., and she previously competed for Canada. The 16th-seeded Dabrowski and Routliffe saved five break points in the first set, including four in the fifth game en route to a tiebreaker. They took an early 4-0 lead and held off the 12th-seeded Siegemund and Zvonareva for an 11-9 decision to take the first set. Dabrowski and Routliffe started quickly in the second set when they broke their opponents their first two times serving. Siegemund and Zvonareva countered with a break of their own, but Dabrowski and Routliffe remained in control and saw out the set with another break to lift the trophy.
