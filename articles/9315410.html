                The wall of silence sounded the death knell on Irelands qualification hopes - and left Stephen Kenny facing the chop. Focus now turns to whether the manager rides out the storm. If he does, it will be his biggest victory yet. Aviva Stadium had been a cauldron of noise after a particularly powerful rendition of the national anthem, and then a dream start straight from the Carlsberg playbook. READ MORE: Ireland v Netherlands score recap and result Adam Idahs penalty had the stadium rocking like never before under Kenny and, for 15 minutes, it was an Irish performance you could really get behind. Kennys seemingly never-ending pursuit of a signature victory was finally in his grasp when he needed it most, after a back to basics approach. But in a game that Kenny could not afford to lose for all sorts of reasons, Holland soon equalised with a spotkick of their own. And while they were no great shakes - and not a patch on France - you could sense the dream was starting to slip from reach, once and for all. The intensity with which Ireland played just couldnt be maintained and Wout Weghorst knew of Irelands knack of conceding early goals in the second half of games. And when the former Manchester United striker scored 11 minutes after the break, he let the air out of Irelands desperate mission on a night when only a win would do. In that moment, Aviva Stadium was the quietest place in the capital save for the handful of travelling supporters who sang Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life. For the first time in Kennys reign, his name was booed when the stadium announcer ran through the starting teams and managers before kick-off. There were sections who cheered for him too, but it still felt like a significant turning point nonetheless in that relationship between the believers and the wanna-believers. The FAI now have a big decision to make on whether they leave Kenny in charge for next months games with Greece and Gibraltar. If this is to be Kennys final game as Ireland boss, he went down fighting as his team brought the fight to the Dutch but just lacked the class and composure to see it out. Kenny has always strived to do a good job as Ireland manager, but executing that masterplan has been a recurring problem and source of frustration. For the third campaign running, Ireland are out of contention for automatic qualification early doors and that rests at Kennys door. Any hope of making it to Euro 2024 now depends on the Nations League playoff path - a convoluted lottery that wont become clearer until late November. But it didnt have to be this way. The wall of noise at the end of the anthem was quite something, but nothing compared to the reaction that greeted Idahs lead goal. Holland dithered playing the ball out from the back and were nearly punished only for Chiedozie Ogbenes close range shot to deflect for a corner, from which Virgil van Dijk handled James McCleans inswinger. Idah stepped up to bury only his second senior goal having opened his account in Junes win here over Gibraltar. Aviva Stadium was bouncing and the Dutch were shook, unable to cope with Ireland's frenzied approach. McCleans crunching tackle on Dumfries was, well, a touch agricultural and left Ronald Koeman spitting fire, but it was more petrol for the cause and the home fans loved it. And Kennys Ireland were not afraid to show a different side to their game. An old fashioned dollop of put it in the mixer certainly got the juices flowing and all of McCleans corners caused utter panic in the Dutch defence, but just lacked a finish. So, too, Ogbenes perfectly weighted cross from the left which saw Shane Duffy and John Egan launch into orbit only to narrowly miss out on that vital connection. But just in case anyone was starting to get carried away with themselves, Holland hit Ireland with a reality check after winning a penalty of their own, 15 minutes after that Irish opener, which Cody Gakpo dispatched. Van Dijks crossfield ball had been cut out by Matt Doherty but he headed it straight to Gakpo and the Liverpool ace played a sublime through ball for Dumfries - Duffy played him on - only for Gavin Bazunu to haul him down in the box. Bazunu, who got fingertips to the spotkick, then denied Donyell Malen soon after but although Holland were gaining a foothold, Ireland remained a threat. Idah and Van Dijk enjoyed quite the battle while Alan Browne and Jason Knight were so tenacious in their press that the Dutch constantly diced with danger. But Ogbene should have done better when Browne - having piled on the pressure in the visiting box, teed up Idah who in turn squared to the Luton Town man, but his laboured touch killed momentum and his shot was deflected for a corner. Later, Brownes tackle in the box on Xavi Simons saved a certain goal but Holland were ramping up their efforts and snatched the lead. Frenkie de Jongs clipped a ball to Dumfries was class and he headed it back across goal for Weghorst - a half-time sub - to hook home after beating Duffy to the ball. And that was that for Ireland, their hopes of automatic qualification and quite possibly the manager. Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts .
