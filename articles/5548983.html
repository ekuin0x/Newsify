We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Buildings in the Glenkens are being made more energy efficient thanks to a new report. Glenkens Community and Arts Trust (GCAT), which runs a community spaces network, asked Dalry-based Natural Power Consultants to look at 11 public buildings  ranging from town and village halls to the CatStrand arts centre in New Galloway  to see how their energy efficiency could be improved. The report also included details of how the committees responsible for the hall could apply for funds to carry out the work, with the findings already used to kick off improvements at three of the buildings.

Zara Gell of Crossmichael Community Trust, which is responsible for the building, said: Having the technical back-up of this report gave us the confidence to apply for the capital funds we need to make the hall a much warmer and more pleasant place to come for the whole community. It was great that the community spaces network could commission it on behalf of all of us, and its been so useful already, along with their continuing support. GCAT also asked Natural Power to look to see how two typical homes  a post-war bungalow and a stone-built cottage  could be upgraded to make them cheaper and more environmentally friendly to heat. Funding for the reports came from the Scottish Governments Community Led Vision fund, administered by the council.

Its been great to have the funding to allow us to commission these two technical reports that will support both hall committees, home-owners and landlords to make effective and appropriate upgrades. GCAT is hosting an event at the Smiddy in Balmaclellan at 7.30pm on Tuesday to answer questions about the reports. People can also hear from Natural Power engineers about how the report could save them money and reduce carbon emissions.
