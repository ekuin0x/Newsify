                LIVE US Open - Men's final LIVE: Novak Djokovic chases record 24th singles Grand Slam title in repeat of 2021 final against Daniil Medvedev By Dan Cancian For Mailonline Published: 20:12, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 21:08, 10 September 2023 e-mail 7 View comments Advertisement Follow Mail Sport's live blog for updates for all the latest on the US Open final ... 20:11 Is the first set crucial? Djokovic has lost all five US Open finals in which he's lost the first set, while he's 72-1 at Flushing Meadowns when winning the opening set. Medvedev, meanwhile, is 27-0 at the US Open when winning the opening set and is a world-leading 47-1 when winning the first set this year. 20:08 The pre-match entertainment is underway Nobody does pageantry before sporting events quite like the US. If you're not familiar withthe NFL, NBA and the MLB or the wonderful world of college sports, then welcome along. This is the norm. Are you're wondering whether a version of America The Beautiful before the national anthem is really necessary? Well, strictly speaking probably not, but why hold a simple sporting event when it can instead be drenched in razzmatazz and entertainment? 20:02 A look at Coco Gauff's triumph on Saturday While we wait for the players to arrive on the court - the 9pm scheduled start time has come and gone, and it always seemed a tad optimistic - here's a reminder of Coco Gauff's triumph yesterday. Coco Gauff wins US Open! 19-year-old tennis star stuns Aryna Sabalenka Coco Gauff, the 19-year-old American tennis sensation, is now a Grand Slam winner. The world's sixth-ranked woman upset Aryna Sabalenka at the US Open following some early struggles for Gauff. Mail Online 19:56 A word on the weather New York has been battered by rain today and while the weather has improved, the rain at the Arthur Ashe Arena is expected to be closed for the men's final. Which is good news for both players as Djokovic and Medvedev both thrive indoors. 19:51 A long night ahead? If you're considering staying up to watch the final, and there are plenty of reasons to suggest you should, you may want to be aware this could be a very long night. In the last 15 years, only three times the US Open men's singles final was over in straight sets. 19:43 Medvedev wary of Djokovic's threat In the final two years ago, Medvedev reduced Djokovic to tears, a sight rarely seen in courts across the world. While another showdown between the Serb and Carlos Alcaraz is what everyone wanted to see, how the crowd reacts will be only one fascinating aspect of the final that has materialised. Medvedev is not fussed about playing the pantomime villain here, and after beating the Spaniard again made sarcastic gestures to the stands seeking acclaim. He has a history of doing that at raucous Flushing Meadows, even more so than the often sensitive Djokovic. 'He is always better than previous time he plays, said the Russian. For example, I beat him in the (2021) US Open final; he beat me in (Paris) Bercy in a great match. Carlos [Alcaraz] US Open: Medvedev hopes for a repeat of 2021 final vs. Djokovic MIKE DICKSON IN NEW YORK: Daniil Medvedev managed to do something on a tennis court that Carlos Alcaraz never accomplished at Wimbledon - help reduce Novak Djokovic to tears. Mail Online beat him Wimbledon; then Novak beat him in Cincinnati. 19:38 Here's how Djokovic reached yet another final The 36-year-old reached the US Open final after beating local hero Dan Shelton 6-3 6-2 7-6. He then mimicked the young American's previous victory gesture of holding an imaginary phone to his ear  and then taking it one step further by slamming down the receiver. Novak Djokovic beats Ben Shelton to reach the US Open final MIKE DICKSON IN NEW YORK: Ben Shelton continued to captivate Flushing Meadows last night, but was ultimately handed a schooling by the brilliant champion sixteen years his senior. Mail Online 19:33 Medvedev: 'Djokovic is going to be at his best on Sunday' Medvedev may have knocked out the defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-final, but he's not getting carried away ahead of another meeting with Djokovic. 'I think the only way I can use [the 2021 final] is thinking that Novak, when he loses, he's never the same after. He's different. It's just a different mentality,' he said. 'That's why he has 23 Grand Slams, many Masters 1000s [titles] and weeks at number one. 'So I have to use it knowing that he's going to be 10 times better than he was that day, and if I want to still beat him, I have to be 10 times better than I was that day. That's what I'm going to try to do. 'Novak is going to be his best version on Sunday, and I have to be the best-ever version of myself if I want to try to beat him.' 19:27 A look back at 2021 Djokovic and Medvedev met on this stage two years ago, with the Russian prevailing 6-4,6-4,6-4 to deny Djokovic a calendar Grand Slam. It remains the Russian's only Grand Slam title to date and tonight will be the fifth time Medvedev has played in the final of one of the four majors. 19:25 Djokovic: 'It's another shot for history' Djokovic is well aware of what's at stake tonight in New York. 'I understand every time in a Grand Slam final, it's another shot for history,' he said. 'I'm aware of it, and of course I'm very proud of it. 'But I don't have much time, nor do I allow myself to reflect on these things or think about the history too much. 'When I did that in the past, like the 2021 final here, I was maybe overwhelmed with the occasion and the opportunity, and I underperformed. 'I don't want this to happen again. I'll try to just focus on what needs to be done and tactically prepare myself for that match.' 19:20 Novak Djokovic stands on the brink of history Novak Djokovic is one win away from a a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title. The Serbian has won 23 majors, one fewer than Margaret Court's all-time record. Djokovic lost in five sets in an epic final against Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon and now has another shot at matching Court's record. 19:17 Good evening!
