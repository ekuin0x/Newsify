Advertisement Growing numbers of underground Tube stations now have 4G and 5G services with many more to come as we continue to build a better London for everyone The first stations on the network to get 4G connectivity underground were those on the Jubilee Line between Canning Town and Westminster in March 2020 TfL said that more than 10 per cent of Tube stations with platforms that are underground and therefore usually unable to get a mobile signal now have 4G and 5G mobile coverage When combined with sections of the Underground which are above ground this means that around 60 per cent of the whole network has mobile coverage as it stands Andy Lord Londons Transport Commissioner said Its great to see the first Tube stations in the West End getting highspeed mobile coverage on their phones within the station as part of the next stage of our project with Boldyn Networks to bring 4G and 5G to the whole Tube network We are committed to delivering this programme which will allow customers to be more connected underground and get the latest travel information and news as well as stay in contact with work friends and families while travelling on our network More stations including the first Elizabeth line stations will be connected in the coming months and we remain committed to having a significant proportion of the entire Tube network connected by the end of 2024 About 500 people are said to have been working overnight across the Underground network to install mobile equipment with all works tidied away before the network opens for travel each morning More than 1200 miles 2000km of cabling as well as thousands of radios are expected to eventually be installed within tunnels and stations once fitted outside of operational hours TfL said initial testing will soon begin on the Bakerloo Victoria Piccadilly lines ahead of technology being installed to allow 4G and 5G to be brought in on these lines later this year Coverage will also be introduced at additional platforms at Oxford Circus as well as other interchange stations the transport body added There are also future plans to extend 4G coverage to the Circle and District lines in 2025 or 2026 Billy DArcy chief executive of Boldyn Networks in the UK and Ireland said We are incredibly proud of the successful launch of highspeed mobile coverage at Londons first West End Tube stations This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team and our valued partners the Mayor of London and TfL We are excited to bring cuttingedge 4G and 5G connectivity to the entire Tube network empowering millions of commuters and tourists to stay connected while travelling through these iconic stations We look forward to continuing to bring mobile coverage to even more stations making a lasting impact on the way people experience public transport in the capital Boldyn Networks was awarded a 20year concession by TfL in June 2021 to deliver 5Gready mobile connectivity across the entire Underground network Dee Corsi chief executive of the New West End Company said In todays world an uninterrupted connection is an expected part of any visitor experience It is great to see that even more visitors travelling here on the Tube network will now be able to plan their trip whilst on route and then jump onto our superfast free street WiFi on arrival The younger shopper in particular is taking full advantage of our West End street WiFi to save using their own data Share or comment on this article Revealed The first FOUR Elizabeth line stops to get superfast 4G coverage
