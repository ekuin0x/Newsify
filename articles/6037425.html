                Rory McIlroy (Image: Getty) Rory McIlroy has revealed he absolutely despised golf rival Billy Horschel until the pair became friends. McIlroy rose to stardom in the golf world in 2007 when he turned professional and has since gone on to win four major championships, including two PGA Championships, one Open title, and one US Open title. During the course of his career, the Northern Irishman has formed a number of rivalries in the sport.

McIlroy competed against Horschel who was representing the US at the Royal County Down Golf Club in Northern Ireland. The tournament was taking place in McIlroys home country, and the golf star recalled why he was initially not a fan of Horschel. He was speaking about the American in comparison to Patrick Reed, whom he formed a rivalry with at the 2016 Ryder Cup during the Sunday singles matches. McIlroy was speaking on the Subpar podcast where he was asked who he hated more - Horschel at the 2007 Walker Cup or Reed at the 2016 Ryder Cup. McIlroy answered swiftly by saying Horschels name, before going on to give an explanation. And thats saying something, McIlroy said after giving his answer, while laughing. He added: I absolutely despised him and weve actually become really close since, which is great, but I think as well we were all probably obnoxious at the time but I think he was pretty rude to the crowd at times I was like theyre my people I was like Im going to beat his a**.

McIlroy will not have the chance to revive the rivalry between himself, Horschel and Reed anytime soon. McIlroy will be competing at the Ryder Cup for Team Europe at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Italy at the end of the month. Neither Reed nor Horschel have qualified or been selected for Team USA at this years tournament. Reed hasnt been competing on the PGA Tour since joining breakaway league LIV Golf, while Horschel finished 90th in the FedEx Cup standings this season and 86 places behind McIlroy in fourth.
