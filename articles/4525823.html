                Speaking at the event on Wednesday, which has welcomed 200 global investors to Belfast for the , Chris Heaton-Harris admitted that the political stalemate here is not the most ideal situation. However, he continued: One of the tangible benefits of about 500 tangible benefits [of the Windsor Framework] are sat next door [investors]. Lots of people in that room are here because they see benefits for their businesses to invest in NI, because of what the Windsor Framework is bringing and on October 1 the first phase of the Framework comes in, and we will see a big difference in how trade goes. The Conservative MP added that businesses potentially interested in investing in Northern Ireland know that the UK government is doing everything they can to get over the hump of a lack of functioning Executive here. I also think what they're seeing is a huge government presence, to demonstrate working all together that we can drive and bring lots of opportunities for businesses here. When questioned on concerns facing NI such as the housing crisis and lack of a direct air link between Northern Ireland and the US, the UK Secretary of State for Business and Trade said that business is just one of the ways we can solve these problems. Kemi Badenoch continued: That's not saying that there are no problems or we are not paying attention to the problems, but there is a lot to learn in terms of what it is that can help businesses prosper. There are quite a lot of unique opportunities in NI which both the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland doesnt have, and we need to emphasise that. At the core of the Windsor Framework is a new system for the flow of goods. Anything destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will travel there as part of a green lane, with significantly fewer checks. Anything that could cross the border and enter the EUs single market will travel through a separate red lane. Investors from across the world including the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific will attend the summit today. It comes as professional services firm in Northern Ireland over the next five years. Once in place, the jobs are expected to contribute at least 33m in annual salaries to the NI economy. The NIIS is being held at conference centre ICC Belfast, with delegates including US Special Economic Envoy Joe Kennedy, appointed by President Joe Biden to encourage US firms to invest in Northern Ireland.
