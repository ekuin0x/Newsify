                THE FAI is at the centre of a storm after it emerged a childrens soccer team has been suspended for failing to give personal information on youngsters. It has emerged the Data Protection Commission has asked to meet with soccer chiefs over the dispute. It comes after Wicklow club Ardmore Rovers was suspended by the Dublin and District Schoolboys/girls League for failing to provide details about the children involved.

The Ballywaltrim-based club was not provided with fixtures by the DDSL after it advised members not to use the registration system due to data protection concerns. A coach said the clubs have been told if their players are not registered the DDSL will not allow them to play and there is no other option open. He added: Kids are not being kicked out of the league but until they are registered, they cant play. Many teams have sought legal advice and clubs are now awaiting the outcome of the meeting with the data commission this week to see about next steps. Its for determining age so older players cannot play in younger age groups. If a parent/guardian is making the application on their childs behalf that should be enough. He said in the past forms were completed and signed by parents. In a Facebook statement, an Ardmore Rovers spokesman said: We are disappointed in the DDSL decision not to provide fixtures for our teams. This is as a result of us advising our members not to use the DDSL registration system until all concerns regarding data security, privacy and protection were resolved. The matter is now with the Data Protection Commissioner. We will update our members as soon as possible on this urgent matter and hope to have our teams playing football as soon as possible. The DPC said it will meet with the sports governing body in order to discuss parents concerns. Deputy commissioner of the DPC Graham Doyle said: We have been in contact with the FAI on this matter and have arranged to meet with them next week. This summer the DDSL introduced new rules which required all players to register before they would be eligible to play. Parents were required to register their children and upload details and the photo page of their childs passport, birth certificate or Department of Justice certificate.
