Lamara Bell, 25, and John Yuill, 38, died after their car left the motorway near Stirling and careered down an embankment when returning from a camping trip in July 2015. They were left lying in their Renault Clio for three days before being discovered, despite police previously being alerted to the incident.

Police Scotland requested the delay at a preliminary hearing in January saying that the inquiry into the death of Sheku Bayah was taking up resources. It follows Police Scotland's conviction at the High Court in Edinburgh for health and safety failings which materially contributed to Ms Bells death in September 2021, where they were fined 100,000. Lamara Bell died in hospital (Image: UGC) That December, the family of Ms Bell was awarded more than 1 million in damages in a civil settlement. Police Scotland Chief Constable Sir Iain Livingstone apologised to the families following the court case. A call was made to police to report the crash on July 5, 2015, but it wasnt followed up and officers only attended three days later when a further 999 call was made. John died at the scene while Lamara passed away in hospital on July 12.

Both John and Lamara's family have said that they are hoping to get more answers into their deaths with some questions left unanswered. Johns father, Gordon Yuill, previously said the family have questions over why police scrapped the car involved without permission. While Solicitor Andrew Bergin who spoke on the behalf of Ms Bells mother Diane told the court his clients concerns throughout proceedings pertain mainly to how the crash occurred and whether or not Lamara may have survived with prompt medical care. An FAI is not a criminal inquiry and is used to establish facts rather than apportion blame. Procurator Fiscal Andy Shanks, who leads on death investigations for COPFS, said: Following a thorough and detailed investigation and criminal prosecution this Fatal Accident Inquiry will look at the full circumstances surrounding these tragic deaths and help avoid such an incident happening again. The families of Lamara Bell and John Yuill and their legal representatives will continue to be updated as the Inquiry progresses.
