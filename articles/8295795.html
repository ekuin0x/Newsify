                BREAKING NEWS: Three man tied to botched plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are found NOT GUILTY by jury William Null, twin brother Michael Null and Eric Molitor were found not guilty The Nulls and Molitor were accused of supporting the plan by participating in military-style drills and traveling to see Whitmers vacation home Adam Fox and Barry Croft were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy last year By Germania Rodriguez Poleo For Dailymail.Com Published: 11:09 EDT, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 11:56 EDT, 15 September 2023 e-mail 1 View comments Three last three men men accused of being involved in a botched plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer have been found not guilty in the scheme. William Null, twin brother Michael Null, 41, and Eric Molitor, 39, were found not guilty of providing support for a terrorist act and a weapon charge. The scheme portrayed as an example of homegrown terrorism on the eve of the 2020 presidential election. They were the last of 14 men to face charges in state or federal court. Nine others have been convicted. The Nulls and Molitor were accused of supporting leaders of the kidnap plan by participating in military-style drills and traveling to see Whitmers vacation home in northern Michigan. There were gasps in the courtroom Friday morning as the jury foreperson announced not guilty verdicts, first for the brothers and then Molitor. Deliberations began Thursday morning and lasted a few more hours Friday. Three men accused of being involved in a botched plot to kidnap kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer have been found not guilty Michael Null (left) and William Null (right) at a protest outside the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing. The twin brothers were found not guilty on Friday Eric Molitor, 39, was also declared not guilty. He testified in his own defense, admitting he had attended gun drills and taken rides to check Whitmers property The men cried as they hugged their lawyers and supporters. The key players, Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy last year in a different court. Croft Jr. 47, received the longest sentence of the four co-conspirators, just one day after his ally Adam Fox was sentenced to 16 years behind bars. In the latest trial, the jury heard 14 days of testimony in Antrim County, the location of Whitmers lakeside property, 185 miles (297 kilometers) north of the state Capitol. Whitmer's chief of staff, JoAnne Huls, said the verdicts were disappointing and would "further encourage and embolden radical extremists trying to sow discord and harm public officials or law enforcement." State Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office handled the trial, said the 'verdicts are not what we hoped for.' Authorities have said an attack on Whitmer began to simmer at a regional summit of anti-government extremists in Dublin, Ohio, in the summer 2020. The key players, Adam Fox (lefft) and Barry Croft Jr., were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy last year in a different court Fox, Croft and William Null were in attendance while an FBI informant also inside the gathering secretly recorded profanity-laced screeds threatening violence against public officials. The disgust was also fueled by government-imposed restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to recordings, text messages and social media posts introduced as evidence at trial. Molitor and William Null testified in their own defense, admitting they had attended gun drills and taken rides to check Whitmers property. But William Null said he and his brother broke away when talk turned to getting explosives. Molitor said Fox was 'incredibly dumb' and wouldnt pull off a kidnapping. Assistant Attorney General William Rollstin urged jurors to not be swayed. 'If you help in whole or even in part you've satisfied that element' of the crime, Rollstin said in his closing argument Wednesday. 'Was he helping him to plan? Was he helping him prepare? The answer is absolutely.' Michael Null did not testify and his lawyer took the unusual step of declining to question any witnesses during the trial. Informants and undercover FBI agents were inside the group for months before arrests were made in October 2020. Whitmer was not physically harmed. Nine men were previously convicted in state or federal court, either through guilty pleas or at three other trials, while two others were acquitted. After the plot was thwarted, Whitmer blamed then-President Donald Trump, saying he had given 'comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division.' Out of office, Trump called the kidnapping plan a 'fake deal' in 2022.] Fox and Croft were convicted at a second trial in August, months after a different jury in Grand Rapids, Michigan, couldn't reach a verdict but acquitted two other men. Croft, a trucker from Bear, Delaware, will be sentenced Wednesday. Fox and Croft in 2020 met with like-minded provocateurs at a summit in Ohio, trained with weapons in Michigan and Wisconsin and took a ride to 'put eyes' on Whitmer's vacation home with night-vision goggles, according to evidence. 'People need to stop with the misplaced anger and place the anger where it should go, and that's against our tyrannical ... government,' Fox declared that spring, boiling over COVID-19 restrictions and perceived threats to gun ownership. Whitmer wasn't physically harmed. The FBI, which was secretly embedded in the group, broke things up by fall.
