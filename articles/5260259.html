                Current owner Moshiri is in   with the Miami-based investment firm over a full sale of the club, with reports suggesting an announcement could come as early as this week. But with some concerns around 777 Partners and how they earn their money, with , Palmer believes the Toffees having the devil they know in charge could be better for the future of the football club. Feeling for my many Everton pals, he wrote. The devil they know  Moshiri  could be a better option than the group circling over Goodison. At least Moshiri was trying to do the right things.. even if he failed miserably. Everton fans have been so desperate to get rid of Farhad Moshiri for so long that many have been willing to take anyone who has a bit of cash. But the long-term future of the club is genuinely up in the air because of the issues caused under Moshiris tenure, and another bad owner could see us be in big trouble in years to come. 777 Partners already own several football clubs and while they seem to have the cash to fund these things on the face of it, there are worrying signs that suggest otherwise and moving from Moshiri to them as owners would be the same as jumping out of the frying pan and straight into the fire. We have to get the right person in next to run this club, get us out of the hole were currently in safely and then lay the foundations to build upon once again to get us back to where we belong. This isnt an overnight job and we cant afford to get it wrong, literally. Fans have to be careful what they wish for, because the grass isnt always greener elsewhere.
