The WAP singer, 30, sat down for an interview with SiriusXM and revealed she 'never would've thought' she would end up with the Bad and Boujee rapper, 31, when she first heard his Migos track Versace at a club. Cardi - who just dropped her new single Bongos with Megan Thee Stallion - also explained why their differences make them a good match. Speaking of the passion in their romance, the Bodak Yellow hitmaker said: 'We do be needing that fire.' 'I mean, we're two different people, like we're very, very like different from each other, but I think that's what make us, work.'

'But one thing that we like both love, we both love family. That's one thing and we both love what we do, like we both, we are each other's support system. 'I know that he backs me up a hundred percent and I back him up a hundred percent. I don't care,' she explained. The couple share daughter Kulture, five, and son Wave, two. But there is one thing that sometimes kills the vibe for Cardi B - Offset's Michael Jackson tattoo. During an appearance on New York City's Hot 97's Ebro in the Morning show , she said: 'I really need you to see the Michael Jackson tattoo he got on his stomach. I don't even want to take it there. 'Because it's like, y'all really have to see it, because every single time I, like, y'know, it just be looking at me,' she said as the hosts of the radio show cracked up. She added: 'You gotta see that tattoo. Like, I just ... I'm like — The tattoo really be looking at me like, 'Yeaaaah.' ... I'm not cappin'." And that's not all the Bronx native revealed. She also told the hosts she has at least one dream she hasn't fulfilled yet.

'I mean, we're two different people, like we're very, very like different from each other, but I think that's what make us, work' She's love to be a part of a WWE event and while competing would be a dream, after having two kids she doesn't think her body could handle it. The hosts asked her if she was going to be a part of Wrestle Mania 40 in Philadelphia and she said she would not be acting like Bad Bunny , 29, in the ring. 'Yeah, that motherf***er is jumping though off them ropes. He jumping off them ropes a lot. I just told you that my body got f***ed up after the second one [second child]. 'I told you the second one f***ed me up. I mean, I would love to attend. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I have to perform or slap a b**ch, but I want to go.
