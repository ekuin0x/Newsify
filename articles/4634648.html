                As Richie Sadlier sat in the RTE studio after Irelands 20 loss to France last night he was asked by Darragh Maloney what positives could Ireland take from the game The former Millwall star praised the character and effort of the Irish players before predicting what Stephen Kenny would say to the assembled media after the game Stephen will do what Stephen does began Sadlier Stephen will pick the positives in the performance in a game where we didnt get the result we were looking for READ MORE Irish fans taunt France with Messi chants during 20 loss in Paris Hell say about the effort hell talk about Ogbenes chance hell do the if only and maybe we could have done a bit more Hell praise the attitude and the character of the players and he will mention that there will be a full house on Sunday and how three points against Netherlands will change it all Thats what Stephen Kenny will do In fairness to Sadlier his prediction was nearly spot on After the game Kenny praised the teams effort The players I cant be overly critical of them tonight because they gave absolutely everything of themselves and its about recovering now because that has taken a lot out of them The Ireland boss also bemoaned a lack of quality in the final third and a general difference in quality between the teams I felt in the first half we did initially transition well we counterattacked well Chiedozie and Adam Idah early in the game for the first half hour we certainly did he said France defended well and got goalside of our players It was our next phase Once we setup we needed to penetrate we kept possession a little bit rather than penetrating after that That was an issue for sure To be fair obviously France are a world class team a really top class international team one of the best teams in the world if not the best They didnt have really clearcut chances in the goal I cant fault my players I thought they gave everything really in the match we were beaten by a better team for sure  Finally the Ireland manager also looked forward to Sunday and an electric sold out crowd that will greet the team for the Netherlands game The energy of the home crowd has been special it has been special in those real games Its been electric at home in those games and we need that again on Sunday to pull out the performance of our lives thats what weve got to do Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts
