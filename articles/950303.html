                Sam Burgess has put rumours surrounding his high-profile exit from to bed. The Rabbitohs legend sensationally quit his role as an assistant coach at the club last month on the eve of a final series on which they would just miss out following a late-season collapse. Rumours and stories surrounding his exit ran rife following the shock exit, but the 34-year-old, who played 184 games for the Rabbitohs, cleared it all up on Sunday night. Watch the latest sport on Channel 7 or stream for free on I dont really want to go back into the detail of it all, Burgess told Fox Sports. I went in that morning to do the best thing for the club and for the team in that moment. I thought being there and the distraction that was around, I made what I thought the best decision was for the team at that time to get away from there. A few things had gone on behind closed doors so I think its best just to leave it there and move on. Pressed further on the episode, Burgess laughed off suggestions a rift between he and Russell Crowe, the Hollywood actor who owns the Rabbitohs, forced his hand to leave. It was reported that Crowe hung up on Burgess during a call in which the pair disagreed over Burgesss commitment to the club. Ill clear this up, Burgess responded. We had a good conversation and he said Alright mate, well see you later. Someones got to hang up, he added with a laugh. I dont remember if I pressed the red (button) or he did But there was definitely no animosity whatsoever; I was supposed to be up at his farm this week, but were expecting the baby. High-profile movement at the club didnt end with Burgess, with Canberra superstar Jack Wighton just weeks away from joining the Rabbitohs. Already a Dally M and Clive Churchill medallist, as well as a State of Origin and World Cup winner, many assumed Wighton had shifted to Souths in search of an NRL title, the only piece of silverware hes still missing. But the upbeat Wightons enthusiasm for the move hasnt waned, despite the late-season chaos at the club, with the five-eighth suggesting the turmoil surrounding the Bunnies was probably overblown. Im not there and I wont comment on anything there. For now, I dont believe anything is going on there, he said. It is what it is, people move on and changes are made ... but who knows the actual truth, not you or me. Ill take it in my stride when I make that move and get to that stage but for now Im just concentrating on the Raiders. Wighton admitted it was difficult to witness the ongoing criticism of his great mate and distant cousin Latrell Mitchell, whose perceived special treatment from coach Jason Demetriou was floated as one of the reasons Burgess quit. That criticism included widely condemned comments from Rod Churchill  son of NRL Immortal Clive Churchill  who called Mitchell a cancer and a complete myth. I feel for Latrell, hes one of our best showmen, he brings so much joy to crowds in games, and probably revenue too, Wighton said. They all ride on the back of that and then theres a little slip or stumble, theyre the first to jump on that. Wighton categorically rejected rumours he had refused to play fullback for the Raiders across the last two seasons, suggesting he would peel the oranges for the boys if asked. I played lock for the first time since under-12s this year, Im in the centres out of position now, he said. Ive played fullback before and Id happily go back. No ones asked me, I dont even know where thats come from. -
