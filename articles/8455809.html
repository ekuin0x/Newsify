                Everton 0-1 Arsenal: Leandro Trossard nets winner for Mikel Arteta's side as dogged Toffees remain in the bottom three Trossard was a substitute for Gabriel Martinelli, who went off injured early on Martinelli had a goal ruled out for a narrow offside in the first half at Goodison Listen to the latest episode of Mail Sport's podcast It's All Kicking Off! By Ian Ladyman for MailOnline Published: 18:26 BST, 17 September 2023 | Updated: 18:59 BST, 17 September 2023 e-mail 84 View comments Arsenal 's ambitions are to win the Premier League and we havent said that for a while. Everton are the kind of team that get cheered wildly when they win a corner and we have been saying that for far too long. What we got at Goodison Park was a clash of style, ambition and need. Arsenal wanted all three points. For Everton, one would have doubled their seasons tally. All this added up to a poor, anti-climactic game which had hardly anything going for it save for the fact it wasnt the worst top flight game of the afternoon. A piece of quality won it, at least. Leanardo Trossard  another to come through the finishing school  has found himself on the outside of Mikel Arteta s Arsenal team looking in so far this season and was only on he field because of an injury in the first half to Gabriel Martinelli . His was a lovely goal with 21 minutes left, though, and it was one Arsenal badly needed. Artetas team have not been at their best so far this season and thats a dangerous thing indeed when you are trying to keep in touch with a Manchester City team that wins just about every game it plays. This, then, was a goal as important as it was well-taken. Short corners never used to be a thing at Arsenal. These days they are so very common and when they work as well as the one Artetas players put together here then its easy to understand why. Leandro Trossard scored the winner for Arsenal as they beat Everton 1-0 at Goodison Park The midfielder volleyed in from Bukayo Saka's cross in the second half to break the deadlock Your browser does not support iframes. A succession of passes moved Evertons players out of position and out of the penalty area and when Martin Odegaard played Bukayo Saka to the byline, his cut back was side-footed across Jordan Pickford by Trossards left foot. Taken first time, the shot had some cut on it and looked at first as though it may swing across the far post and wide. Instead, the ball caught enough of the upright to bounce back in to the goal and Arsenal had a lead they never looked like giving up. With Arsenals own goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale replaced for this one by David Raya , it would have been interesting to see if the switch was justified. As it was, Raya hardly had a thing to do. Everton were just about anonymous as an attacking force and its clear this is going to be their problem as this season advances. Sean Dyches team scored twice in drawing at Sheffield United just before the international break but they are the only goals on the Everton ledger after five league games. That is something that will have to change if Everton are to nudge upwards in the table and indeed if Dyche is to survive what may yet be a change in ownership at the club. Arsenals record at Goodison Park is alarmingly poor but here at least they tried to force the issue from the outset. Indeed much of the first half hour of football was played in the Everton half. The home teams tactics when they didnt have the ball were identifiable. Stay in shape and work hard. Largely, it worked. Arsenal chances were thin on the ground in the opening period. When Dyches team did have the ball, however, things were more muddled. Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford seemed reluctant to play the ball along. Instead there were some uncomfortable moments for Everton as they passed the ball around in their own penalty area before inevitably succumbing to the inevitable and clearing it up the field, only with less sense of calm or purpose than their goalkeeper may have shown. Nevertheless, Everton remained in the game and that was the most important thing for a team without a league win this season.

They stuck to their principles, looking to work angles on the edge of the Everton penalty area but the home defence was stoic and eager for work and most routes to goal were closed by those in blue. Arsenal did have the ball in the net in the 20th minute only for the VAR officials to call it offside. It was a close one, Eddie Nketiah coming from deep to lay the ball off to Fabio Vieira who then played Martinelli through to score. The VAR lines showed the call to be desperately tight but this time  unlike when Manchester United had a goal chalked off at the Emirates a fortnight earlier  Arsenal did not get the benefit of considerable doubt. It had been a neat and incisive piece of play by Arsenal, probably their best of the opening half. They also may have had a claim that the ball had reached Nketiah from an Everton player. That would have ruled him onside. But Netos intervention was clearly judged to have been non-deliberate. Confused? Well, you probably arent the only one. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta showed his frustration during the game as his side struggled to create chances Everton themselves were direct with their play but failed to test Raya too often in the away goal Soon after Martinelli left the field with what appeared to be a hamstring injury and as such Arsenals task became a little harder. There were a couple of half chances thereafter in the half as a Declan Rice shot was blocked and another from Ben White was held high by Everton goalkeeper Pickford. Everton themselves didnt muster a shot on goal until after all of this. A strong run forward by Abdoulaye Doucoure ended with him in a heap in the Arsenal penalty area just after the half hour. He hadnt been touched, as it happened. But when the ball was recycled, another midfielder in the shape of Idriss Gueye did manage to deliver a shot from distance that Raya saved comfortably down to his right. Evertons foray continued to be limited in the second half also. More pleasingly for the home team, so did Arsenal opportunities. One raking pass from Aleksandr Zinchenko to substitute Leonardo TRossard opened up Everton but the Belgian  who ran on to cross low  was called offside. Zinchenko then drove for goal and appealed for a handball against James Tarkowski even though the Everton defenders arm was tucked close to his body. That one didnt even go to VAR. Arsenal didnt look like scoring, in truth. But then with 21 minutes to go, they did. Trossard's strike triggered jubilant scenes as Arteta's outfit finally breached a resilient defence The Gunners players celebrated at full time as they kept pace with the Premier League front-runners early on Sean Dyche's Everton have logged just one point from their opening five games of the season A short corner from the right was worked through Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard and then Bukayo Saka and when the England winger pulled the ball back Trossard side footed the ball across Pickford and n to the far corner off the post with great skill. In a poor game, this was a lead Arsenal deserved as much for intent and territory as much as anything else. Everton just hadnt offered enough and even though Arnaud Danjuma had volleyed over from 18 yards just before the Arsenal goal, they now had a real mountain to climb. With increased need came an increased risk, of course. And when Everton were caught with numbers forward in the 77th minute Arsenal broke. Odegaard may have passed left to Saka but went alone. Pickford saved that one but may not have had a prayer with Vieiras follow up had Vitalii Mykolenko not intervened with a superb block. In to the final ten minutes and Everton were offering very little. They were, at least, still in the game. They didnt create a chance, though, and though the home support seemed upset at referee Simon Hoopers decision to add on only four minutes at the end, the protests seemed rather pointless. An equaliser had hardly been coming. IT'S ALL KICKING OFF! It's All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport that promises a different take on Premier League football.
