                People are finally being given the chance to have their say on Aberdeen library closures  months after they were mothballed. A new consultation has been launched ask for thoughts on the demise of Cornhill, Cults, Ferryhill, Kaimhill, Northfield and Woodside libraries.

Could it force the council to reopen the libraries? The consultation will give the local authority the chance to look at the direct impact the six library closures have had on their communities. If it is found that there is enough demand for the libraries, or it appears likely a legal battle wont be worth fighting, the council could consider opening them up once again.
