                Hurricane Lee to hit US TODAY with 80mph winds and 20ft waves: Maine declares state of emergency as Long Island homeowners batten down the hatches Lee will trigger potentially life threatening storm surges on Friday and Saturday Maine and Massachusetts Category 1 storm sparked first hurricane warning in Maine in 15 years - state of emergency has been declared Nantucket, Cape Cod and coastal Long Island also bracing for the storm's impact By Jen Smith, Chief Reporter and Associated Press Published: 13:22, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 16:56, 15 September 2023 e-mail 23 shares 55 View comments Advertisement Hurricane Lee is racing towards New England, bringing 20ft waves, 85mph winds and triggering warnings across Maine , Massachusetts , New York and Canada amid fears of deadly storm surges and tornados. The storm tore through the Caribbean overnight, smashing the Dominican Republic and Bermuda before barreling north with New England in its sights. It will make landfall in Canada but will trigger enormous waves in much of coastal New England on its way. In an announcement this morning, the National Hurricane Center said tropical storm conditions will begin in the US this afternoon. In the Hamptons, waterfront homeowners are racing to secure their houses before the storm arrives. DailyMail.com captured many rushing to pad their homes with sand on Friday as the storm approached. One property on stilts on Dune Road, a notoriously expensive street, appeared to be on a particularly precarious perch. Houses on a tiny stretch of land in the Hamptons between Shinnecock Bay and the Atlantic brace for Hurricane Lee on Friday. Workers on the narrow patch of Dune Road are working to protect the road and land before the storm hits later today and tomorrow Race against Lee: Workers rush to a house on stilts on Long Island's Dune Road in Hampton Bays In Maine, the Governor has issued a hurricane warning for the first time in 15 years while the National Guard in Long Island are poised to sandbag homes and respond to emergencies. In New Jersey , anyone who goes swimming will be fined up to $200 while beach warnings are in place. After a deluge of rain, flooding, sinkholes and tornadoes this week, New England is about to face Hurricane Lee. As the Category 1 system impacted Bermuda, Maine was under its first hurricane watch in 15 years and a state of emergency declared Thursday by Gov. Janet Mills. The water-logged region prepared for 20-foot (6-meter) waves offshore and wind gusts up to 80 mph (129 kph), along with more rain. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Woman pouring her brother's 'ashes' into pool at Ibiza club Watch video Prince Harry helps a four-year-old girl reach her medal winning dad Watch video Hit-and run driver chats to friend after killing two in horror crash Watch video We've spent 20M a year in security: Iceland boss on shoplifting Watch video 'Woke' Theresa May thinks immigration is good for the country Watch video Meghan Markle is seen 'Marching' at the Cycling medal ceremony Watch video Rebecca English says Meghan left Harry looking like a 'spare part' Watch video Moment GMB's Kate Garraway tears into Health Secretary Steve Barclay Watch video Policing Minister on Channel migrants: 'We will stop those boats' Watch video Chaos at Gatwick airport due to air traffic controller calling in sick Watch video Drunk stripper tries SEDUCING officer after stop for a hit-and-run Watch video Driver and motorcyclist brawl near roundabout in 'road rage' bust-up Coastal houses on Long Island are among those most at risk.

Powerful winds and coastal flooding were expected to arrive Friday afternoon in southern New England and spread north. Although Lee did not contribute to the flooding that hit New England earlier in the week, it threatened to exacerbate conditions in a region that is already waterlogged. The Coast Guard and emergency management agencies warned New England residents to be prepared, and utility companies brought in reinforcements to deal with any power outages. At Boothbay Harbor Marina in Maine, the community came together to remove boats from the water to keep them out of harm's way. 'Its a batten-down-the-hatches kind of day,' owner Kim Gillies said Thursday. Surfers spend a day at Rockaway Beach as impact from Hurricane Lee delvers large surf and rip tides to much of the Northeast on September 14, 2023 in New York City.
