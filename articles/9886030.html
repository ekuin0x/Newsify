                There are many movies and roles that have demanded an actor to go above and beyond their imagination. From Heath Ledger locking himself up in a room for days to prepare for Jokar to an actor smoking 30 cigarettes a day, many demands have led to serious repercussions on an artist's mental and physical health. However, nothing quite comes close to asking Salman Khan to 'grow chest hair' for a role. In an interview with Bollywood Bubble, Anurag Kashyap recalled the time he was 'ghosted' from the 2003 movie which went on to become one of the biggest critical hits in Salman Khan's career. ''I was not asked to leave Tere Naam, the film ghosted on me,'' Anurag clarified and added, ''I asked Salman a certain thing and after that, nobody got back to me. I didnt not even know when the film started shooting, and what happened''. He also revealed that late actor/director Satish Kaushik who ended up directing Tere Naam was not aware of Anurag's initial involvement. ALSO SEE: The Gangs Of Wasseypur director also revealed that he was heavily involved in the script and was just about to start to shoot the film. ''I just asked Salman to grow chest hair and he also didnt say anything. It was the producer who reacted,'' Anurag recalled. As funny and odd as the situation sounds today, it must have been difficult for Anurag Kashyap to bid adieu to the project unbeknownst of the reason behind it. Anurag Kashyap further revealed that he has never met Salman Khan since 's mishap. However, they have exchanged basic pleasantries on a few occasions. ALSO SEE: Cover Image: Sourced
