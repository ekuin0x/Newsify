                Strictly's Krishnan Guru-Murthy reveals 'there will be a defibrillator' on hand while he performs after doctors warned he could 'drop dead' due to a genetic heart condition By Bethan Edwards For Mailonline Published: 11:40 BST, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 12:23 BST, 13 September 2023 e-mail 5 View comments Krishnan Guru-Murthy has revealed that Strictly Come Dancing bosses will have a defibrillator on set while he performs after he was diagnosed with a genetic heart condition. The Channel 4 newsreader, 53, has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which has killed two of his cousins and it might prevent his progress on the hit BBC show. He has said that it is important that he 'keeps his heart out of the red zone' and his cardiologist could not promised 'he won't drop dead' while performing. Krishnan told The Sun : 'The basic advice is, I've got to keep my heart out of the red zone, which is the last 15 per cent of your heart rate. 'So, I've got to keep my heart rate below about 140, and I don't know whether you can do that or not, in a 90-second very fast dance. 'I have to listen to my body': Krishnan Guru-Murthy has revealed he will be stepping onto the Strictly Come Dancing dance floor with his doctor's warning in his ears Wow: The newsreader, 53, has a genetic heart condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which has killed two of his cousins and it might prevent his progress on the hit BBC show 'My cardiologist basically said, ''I can't give you a hundred per cent guarantee that you won't drop dead, but you'll be fine''. The Charleston will be a challenge, but we'll see.' It means that the BBC will have a defibrillator on standby in case of any emergencies. He added: 'I have to listen to my body. I have that condition Elvis had and footballers have when they can suddenly drop. The task for me is more about training and not raising my heart level for longer periods of time than a two-minute dance. There will be a defibrillator for me. I have a heart condition but it doesn't mean you can't do Strictly.' Krishnan has the full backing of his wife Lisa who encouraged his decision to get out his comfort zone and hit the dancefloor. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes the wall of the heart chamber to thicken, meaning they can become stiff and therefore reducing the amount of blood taken in and pumped out to the body with each heartbeat. After covering the likes of the pandemic and Ukraine war, Krishnan went on to explain that his 'stressful and very intense' job was what pushed him to do something fun like Strictly. The latest celebrities to take on the dancing competition were recently teamed up with their new professional partners and have started training. Krishnan admitted he has found the training rather 'overwhelming' so far and his partner keeps telling him to 'just dance' and not to overthink. Dangerous: He has said that it is important that he 'keeps his heart out of the red zone' and his cardiologist has not promised that 'he won't drop dead' while performing Opening up: He has said that it is important that he 'keeps his heart out of the red zone' and his cardiologist has not promised that 'he won't drop dead' while performing It comes after the real reason that Strictly's Nadiya Bychkova wasn't given a celebrity partner for the upcoming series has reportedly been revealed. The Ukrainian professional dancer, 34, joined the show back in 2017 and has had a celebrity partner every year since. However BBC bosses have not partnered her with a famous partner this year, reportedly leaving her 'seething'. Fans have been left furious at the BBC's decision to not give the pro one of their 15 celebrities to dance with, but bosses have hit back saying that there are many factors which determine whether a dancer is chosen to be given a celebrity partner or not, including height and how many years they have been on Strictly. Corporation sources say that when this year's stars and professionals met, there was no chemistry between Ms Bychkova and the male contestants. One told the Mail: 'Nadiya was very surprised when she learned she would merely be part of he wider dance troupe. She felt like she had done well since she joined the show, so it was a shock. 'She wanted answers so she held several meetings with the bosses so she could get some answers. She is accepting it now.' In addition The Sun claims that the reason she was snubbed is because the only male tall enough to be partnered with her was EastEnders star Bobby Brazier, 20, - and there was an 'uncomfortable' 14-year age gap between the pair. Star-studded: Krishnan with join the likes of Love Island's Zara McDermott, EastEnders actor Bobby Brazier and Waterloo Road star Adam Thomas on the BBC show Drama: It comes after the real reason that Strictly's Nadiya Bychkova wasn't given a celebrity partner for the upcoming series has reportedly been revealed The publication claims that at 6ft 2 Bobby would have been one of the only stars tall enough to be partnered with her but that there was no chemistry between them. An insider told the newspaper: 'Nadiya is by far the tallest of all the pros. 'That meant she would have towered over seven out of the eight male celebrities in the competition. On the basis of height, it was expected that they would form a duo on this series. 'The only person she could have been paired with is Bobby but bosses felt there was something odd about the fact that the particularly fresh-faced Bobby only turned 20 this summer, while Nadiya is a mature woman.' Strictly has been contacted by MailOnline for comment. Strictly Come Dancing begins this Saturday at 6.35pm on BBC One. STRICTLY COME DANCING 2023: WHO ARE THE CONTESTANTS?
