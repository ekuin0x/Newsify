market has been segmented by enduser Hospitals and blood banks Clinical laboratories and Academic and research institutes technique PCRbased and microarray techniques assaybased techniques massively parallel sequencing techniques and serology and Geography     and the Rest of the World ROW is estimated to contribute to the growth of the global market during the forecast period The growth of the market in this region is mainly driven by the sale of approved blood group reagents for blood group determination and the increasing incidence of chronic diseases and types of cancer The high incidence of leukemia in the region subsequently increases the adoption of treatment options such as surgical procedures and treatments Blood group testing is necessary for cancer patients because they may need blood transfusions for treatment especially during surgery The availability of a wide range of products thus driving the market growth in this sector can be attributed to the large number of US companies selling blood group reagents Hence these factors are expected to drive market growth in the region during the forecast period Alpha Laboratories Arena Bio Scien Atlas Medical GmbH AXO Science BAG Diagnostics GmbH Bio Rad Laboratories Inc Danaher Corp DIAGAST SAS Grifols SA Haemokinesis Ltd Merck KGaA Mesa Laboratories Inc Novacyt SA QuidelOrtho Corp Quotient Ltd Rapid Labs Ltd Torax Biosciences Ltd Tulip Diagnostics Pvt Ltd Werfenlife SA and Calibre Scientific Inc  The company offers blood grouping reagents such as ALBAcheck Whole Blood Controls and ALBAclone Monoclonal Antisera The market has been segmented by enduser hospitals and blood banks clinical laboratories and Academic and research institutes technique PCRbased and microarray techniques assaybased
