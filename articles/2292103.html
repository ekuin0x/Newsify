                Former international development secretary Rory Stewart said it is a miracle that some of his former colleagues have not died by suicide, while others have had total breakdowns in public<br>-  Speaking ahead of publication of his new memoir, Politics On The Edge, Mr Stewart also said he despised the creeping MP he became before leaving the Commons in 2019<br>-  I dont want to talk about the specifics because this is deeply personal to people but, yes, colleagues tried to kill themselves, he told GB News<br>-  These are people I knew<br>-  And in very serious ways  I mean they almost killed themselves<br>-  Its a miracle they arent dead<br>-  There were other colleagues who had total breakdowns in the most humiliating, personal, embarrassing fashion possible, in public<br>-  He went on: I think it is because the gap between the way that MPs are encouraged to present themselves to the public and who they really are is almost unsustainable<br>-  Its mad, because youre pretending to be all-knowing, perfect, dynamic, confident<br>-  You are pretending that youve got the answers to everything, and that I know where were going<br>-  The truth is, this is a country of 70 million people, and politicians dont really know whats going on<br>-  And yet we pretend to the public that we do<br>-  Asked how he felt when he was an MP, he said: I ended up despising myself<br>-  I would find myself sort of creepily trying to sit next to David Cameron at lunch, and Id send these texts saying, you know, Congratulations on your latest policy that I didnt really believe in<br>-  And so I began to feel that I was being made, in my early 40s, into some kind of child<br>-  Id been the acting governor of an Iraqi province responsible for three million people, and a Harvard professor, and Id run a charity in Afghanistan<br>-  I thought that I was a reasonably substantial person<br>-  And I realised that, as soon as I became an MP, all that was wiped out<br>-  Nobody takes you seriously anymore<br>-  But the former Tory leadership candidate said he wished he had become prime minister<br>-  Asked if he wished he was now in the top job, he said: Yes, I do<br>-  I think it would have been a pretty tumultuous ride<br>-  Its not been easy  Brexit, Covid  but I felt that we had a real opportunity in 2019 to try to bring the country together a bit more<br>-  I felt it was terribly kind of divided and fractured<br>-  He said he parted ways with the Conservative Party because I belong to a tradition of a much more centrist, more traditional conservatism, adding: Also, I dont feel comfortable in the direction that the partys going at the moment<br>-  But he said he is not a Labour supporter and believes that both major political parties are basically old, dead and broken<br>-  He said that, while there are some wonderful people at Parliament, there is also a group of people who are very, very bitter  unfortunately, mostly men  who feel passed over and feel that their basic mission in life is to try to humiliate other people<br>-  Mr Stewart went on to tell Sky news it is a miracle that Britain manages to keep going because of the political system<br>-  He said: The truth is, you could not run a fish and chip shop in the way in which the British Government is run<br>-  Its insane<br>-  And I tried to do a good job Its not (that) the politicians are necessarily incompetent or daft<br>-  Its these jobs are mad<br>-  It cannot make sense to put somebody into a job as important as that for just a few months<br>-  He added: We need governments that say you must remain in (post) for a minimum of two years in these jobs, unless you actually have a horrible scandal<br>-  And we need to look to the American system where we have genuine professionals as Cabinet ministers it is a very limited gene pool, MPs  youre taking out about 300 MPs, putting them into these positions<br>-  And, look, Im obviously attacking myself in Politics On The Edge, because Im trying to show how ignorant I was and what a disgrace it is that someone like me gets these jobs<br>-  Mr Stewart continued: I went in idealistic, very, very proud to be in Parliament, thinking Im going to make a real difference, Im going to change the world<br>-  And I found that the system and structure just did not work<br>-  The whips, the party system, these ministerial promotions, the culture of the place was fundamentally not serious<br>-  Its a miracle that Britain manages to actually keep going at all the way that we run our politics<br>-
