                The Lionesses return to action, after their defeat in the World Cup final on August 20, by facing Scotland in Sunderland a week on Friday and the Netherlands in Utrecht four days later to open their campaign in the new competition. The Arsenal players in her squad  forward Alessia Russo and defender Lotte Wubben-Moy  took part in Champions League qualifying matches last Wednesday and Saturday. Wiegman, whose players started their pre-World Cup preparation camp on June 19, told a press conference on Wednesday when asked if she was concerned about the calendar and time off: Yes, I am very worried.  "I like to play finals. Our players do too. But it starts next week, so let's first have a good start."   Lionesses (@Lionesses) I was worried before the World Cup, and we knew this was a very short turnaround. Its a bigger thing  were all talking about the calendar and we really have to get connected with FIFA, UEFA, the federations, and we have to make that better. Of course the game is growing, which is really good. But it has to grow together and players need some rest too. Next week they come in and some players only had six days off, which after such a high-level, high-pressure competition is not good for them. And that has been going on for a long time, because we have major tournaments in the summer all the time. So the urgency to solve it and make it better is really, really high. The players will come in and we first have to see how they are physically, and we have to get them fresh, and do everything to do that. Thats going to be a challenge. Of course you have the team and you want to perform at the highest level, and also you want players to be fresh. For me and my staff its balancing (the) two  is this player fit enough, fresh enough, to play the game? Thats balancing, its so intense, and players are not robots. She added: Ive talked to coaches. I think everyones aware that we have to speak with each other and we can do a little better, and we all know its pretty complex. But I think conversations are going on, and we just need to keep doing that and hopefully find better solutions than we had.
