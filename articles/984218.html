                Sam Kekovich: AFL great goes rogue mid-interview to slam the Voice after being asked about Ron Barassi Sam Kekovich slams the Voice Lamb ad frontman goes rogue READ MORE: AFL Voice snub By David Southwell For Daily Mail Australia Published: 10:51, 17 September 2023 | Updated: 11:06, 17 September 2023 e-mail View comments Former footy great and Australian lamb ambassador Sam Kekovich has unexpectedly used the death of AFL legend Ron Barassi to aim a foul-mouthed swipe at the Indigenous Voice to Parliament referendum. The veer into politics came as Kekovich was being interviewed about his memories of being coached by Barassi in the 1975 and 1977 North Melbourne sides that delivered the club its first two premierships. Barassi, who won an extraordinary 13 premierships as a player and coach, died on Saturday at the age of 87. Kekovich, who has become a cult figure for fronting the annual Australia Day advertising campaigns to eat more lamb, was asked about the suggestion that the AFL premiership cup be named after Barassi. 'I was asked this question numerous times, it's probably a no-brainer, but is that big enough? Big enough recognition?' Kekovich replied.

'You know they want to change the course of our history. Well why don't you p*** that off and name Australia Barassi Country. 'I reckon it would be unanimous. We wouldn't have to have a referendum I can guarantee you. 'I don't know what more you can do but a premiership cup is certainly apt. 'Anything else? I don't know but whatever you do, don't ask the politicians in this country please.' While the AFL officially supports the Voice it has decided not to do any official campaigning on the issue during the finals season. The decision has reportedly disappointed government figures who were hoping for an extra boost for the Yes side as the referendum date of October 14 draws near. A range of ideas to promote the Voice during the finals were reportedly discussed, including boundary line advertising and a recitation. The Voice campaign has garnered support from multiple high-profile current and former AFL players, including retired Essendon great Michael Long. He undertook a walk from Melbourne to Canberra to drum up support for the Voice, and this week said he would also petition King Charles. The Voice campaign has been backed by a number of sporting bodies including the AFL and NRL Kekovich has become a cult figure from fronting the annual Australia Day ad campaigns for lamb A number of other Indigenous AFL champions such as Eddie Betts and Adam Goodes have also trumpeted their support for the Voice. Geelong great turned controversy magnet Sam Newman is one of the few AFL identities who has spoken out against the proposal. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has hit out at the AFL and NRL over their public support for the Yes campaign. 'Their fans are really scratching their head as to why the elites within the sport are taking a position in to the Voice,' Mr Dutton said.
