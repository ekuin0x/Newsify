                The Sports Digitale journalist reported on Wednesday (13 September) that the Portugal international could be on his way to Turkey. The transfer window there is still open which means that the 30-year-old could be out of Goodison Park this week. Via , Sabuncuoglu wrote, smail Kartal has approved the possible transfer of Andre Gomes. Gomes has become a liability at Goodison Park and if there had been no interest shown in him, he would have been rotting in the reserves. Alternatively, he wouldve had his contract terminated as was the case with Jean-Philippe Gbamin. However, it seems like Fenerbahce are serious in their pursuit of the midfielder and the green signal has been given by the manager. This is good news for Everton are someone who was taking up space on the payroll will now be leaving the club and therell be money coming in from his sale. It remains to be seen how much the Toffees will look to demand from him, but they do need to get at least a decent fee. He might be 30 but hes got decent Premier League and international experience for Portugal under his belt and that certainly counts for something.
