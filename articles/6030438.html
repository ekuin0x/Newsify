                North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin visit the Vostochny Cosmodrome space launch center in the Russian Far East, Sept. 13, in this photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency the following day. Yonhap North Korea leader Kim Jong-un said he was "deeply impressed" with the advanced state of Russian aerospace and aviation technology after he visited an aircraft plant during his ongoing visit to Russia this week, Pyongyang's state media said Saturday. Following his summit with President Vladimir Putin, Kim visited the Yuri Gagarin Aviation Plant that produces advanced fighter jets including the Sukhoi Su-35 in the far eastern region of Komsomolsk-on-Amur. "Saying that he was deeply impressed by the rich independent potential and modernity of the Russian aircraft manufacturing industry and its ceaseless enterprising efforts toward new goals, he sincerely hoped that the plant would make sustained development by achieving higher production growth in the future," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. Kim expressed "sincere regard" for Russia's aviation technology undergoing rapid development and "outpacing the outside potential threats," it added.

Founded in 1934, the aviation plant made a "great contribution to defeating fascism" during the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War by producing various kinds of aircraft, including long-range bombers. Today it is the largest Sukhoi-type fighter jet manufacturer in Russia, according to the KCNA. Kim was accompanied by the North's top party and military officials, including Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui and top advisor Marshal Ri Pyong-chol. Also included in the group were Pak Jong-chon, a leader in the Workers' Party of Korea and Pak Thae-song, an official in charge of space technology. The KCNA said Kim departed for his next destination Friday afternoon. He is expected to travel to Vladivostok, and meet Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, and tour the Russian Navy's Pacific fleet base. (Yonhap)
