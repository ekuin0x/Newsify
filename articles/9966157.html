                America's schools are FAILING the COVID generation and older students are still struggling to regain academic footing after years of disruption, scathing new study finds ACT college admission scores are now the lowest since 1991 among the 13.5 million students who are nearing graduation or recently left Rocketing absence levels may be partly to blame, as the study says 16 million students were chronically absent during the 2021-2022 school year The report was published by the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE), a nonpartisan research organization based at Arizona State University By Laura Parnaby For Dailymail.Com Published: 22:00 BST, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 22:39 BST, 13 September 2023 e-mail 19 shares 4 View comments America's schools are 'failing the COVID generation', according to a new report which concluded 'the kids are not alright'. Published by the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE), a nonpartisan research organization based at Arizona State University, the report gave several shocking statistics on the state of the education system. A staggering one-third of fourth and eighth grade students can't read even at a 'basic' level, according to the report . Rocketing absence levels may be partly to blame, as the study says 16 million students were chronically absent - meaning they missed more than 10% of school days - during the 2021-22 year. This is twice the number seen in previous years. More than eight in 10 public schools also reported stunted behavioral and social-emotional development in their students due to the pandemic, according to a May survey cited in the report. America's schools are 'failing the COVID generation', according to a new report which concluded 'the kids are not alright' Published by the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE), a nonpartisan research organization based at Arizona State University, the report gave several shocking statistics on the state of the education system Average math and reading scores plummeted during the pandemic, according to the Nation's Report Card, from the National Assessment of Educational Progress Nearly half of schools also reported an increase in threats of physical attacks among students. The report paid special attention to the 13.5 million students who are nearing graduation or recently left, because their futures are the most likely to have been derailed by the pandemic. In an 'alarming' indication of how hard-hit this demographic has been, ACT college admission scores are now the lowest since 1991. Undergraduate enrollment at public universities and community colleges dropped 7% from 2019 to 2023, with enrollment in two-year colleges declining the most dramatically. 'Three years after the start of the pandemic, COVID-19 is continuing to derail learning, but in more insidious and hidden ways,' the report's authors say. 'Things are far from normal even though students are back in school.' Robin Lake, the director of CRPE, described the situation as 'sobering'. 'We think many students have already graduated without what they need, and that trend will continue unless we do things differently,' he said. The report said inadequate strategies for catching students up were to blame, along with rocketing stress levels among teachers and a decline in the quality of lessons. Only two in 100 students are receiving the kind of high-impact tutoring that makes a difference, according to the report. More than eight in 10 public schools reported stunted behavioral and social-emotional development in their students due to the pandemic, according to a May survey Average math scores for 13-year-olds fell nine points from the 2019-2020 academic year to the 2022-23 year. Pictured: Students sitting a math test One in 5 students graded their schools D or F in mental health supports, individualized instruction, and feeling excited about learning, according to Gallups Spring 2023 survey. Meanwhile, teachers reported rates of stress which were nearly double pre-pandemic levels. The math and reading test scores for 13-year-olds fell dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic . Average math scores for 13-year-olds fell nine points from the 2019-2020 academic year to the 2022-23 year, according to the Nation's Report Card, from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Average reading scores fell four points over the same period, during which the pandemic wrought havoc on the nation's education system, shuttering classrooms and forcing children to study online.
