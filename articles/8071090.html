                The Miami-based investment firm are in to purchase 100% of the Toffees with an announcement tipped to come this week, which would see Farhad Moshiri leave the club after increased scrutiny from fans in recent months. But while speaking on (13 September), former Everton striker Lineker admitted that while a change of ownership is needed he fears it may be too late to help them this season. I think its probably needed at Everton isnt it, but its possibly a little too late to help too much this season, he said. I had a wonderful year at the club and you always have an affinity towards your clubs, and I do love Everton and I had a great year there. The fans and everything, it means so much to them their football club. Obviously theyve got this incredible-looking new stadium thats [coming]. Fingers crossed that its the right takeover for the club at the right time, and it just propels them back to being a team that Everton should be and thats a team challenging for European football, not for trying to stay in the Premier League. Linekers fears are something that a lot of Everton fans have also mentioned in the fallout from the news that 777 Partners look set to come into the club. They own several clubs around the world and none of them are particularly successful on or off the pitch right now, with fans of Standard Liege even protesting against their ownership recently. Moshiri is clearly out of his depth here and the club need to move on from his tenure as owner, but we cant afford to get in new owners who arent interested in making us good again and just want to make money. Thats what 777 Partners seem to be doing at other clubs and that wont help us in our current situation. We need to be nursed back to health and given a platform to build and improve to get away from our current situation. Its great to see a big profile like Lineker share those concerns too, and hopefully the takeover happens but only if its the right thing for the long term future of the club.
