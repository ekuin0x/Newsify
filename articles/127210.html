                Many people buy cryptocurrency in the hope of getting rich But this kind of risky investment doesnt necessarily mean big bucks for everyone In fact relatively few buyers hold millions of dollars worth of crypto assets worldwide according to a recent report While the sector has been experiencing an unprecedented crisis of confidence for several months cryptocurrency remains a widespread investment Some 425 million people hold crypto worldwide of whom 210 million have Bitcoin But far fewer have amassed a small fortune thanks to these virtual currencies The Crypto Wealth Report from investment firm Henley  Partners estimates that only 88200 people worldwide own the equivalent of at least US1mil RM468mil in crypto This represents less than 1 of all users of these virtual currencies Half of them hold this amount in Bitcoin attesting to the popularity of the most famous cryptocurrency There are even fewer crypto centimillionaires and billionaires with the former reportedly totaling just 182 individuals 78 of whom owe their status to Bitcoin holdings The latter category is thought to comprise 22 investors Of these six are reported to be Bitcoin billionaires These figures should be treated with caution however given the highly volatile nature of digital currencies Nevertheless they show that investors are keen to embrace these assets as much out of a taste for easy money as out of distrust of the traditional banking system But interest in crypto varies across age groups and from country to county Its Singapore that tops Henley  Partners Global Crypto Adoption Index The top three also includes Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates followed by Hong Kong in fourth and the United States in fifth place Australia 6th Canada 8th Austria 15th and Portugal 18th have embraced this new form of finance more than France or Belgium for example The geography of cryptocurrency adoption shows that these digital assets are also flourishing in economically challenged emerging countries such as Malaysia 10th Thailand 11th and Antigua and Barbuda 14th Many of the countries most welcoming to cryptocurrency offer advantageous tax regimes to those who own them although some like Portugal heavily tax capital gains on cryptocurrency investments  AFP Relaxnews
