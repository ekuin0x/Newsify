                Apples most important new product unveiling of the year gets underway on Tuesday, when the company will introduce the iPhone 15, new smartwatches and the latest AirPods. The event kicks off from the companys headquarters in Cupertino, California, on 12 September 2023. The most significant new product will be the iPhone 15 Pro line, with more minor refreshes coming to the Apple Watch and the AirPods. The company also is likely to discuss iOS 17, iPadOS 17 and watchOS 10, its upcoming software updates for the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The event, dubbed Wonderlust, wont introduce a flashy new product category  like the Vision Pro headset unveiling in June  but the combination of the iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods remains the core of the companys ecosystem. Together, those products bring in roughly 60% of overall revenue, excluding the money generated by accompanying digital services like Apple Music. The stakes are high this year. Apple is looking to pull out of a sales slump, and its counting on major changes to its high-end iPhones to get people to upgrade. The company also is facing trouble in China, where government workers are increasingly banned from using its devices and consumer sentiment may be turning against US technology. Another wrinkle this year: Apple is switching the phones charging and data port to the USB-C standard, a move that may improve performance but potentially irk consumers. This will mark the second time the iPhones port will change. The last switch came in 2012 when Apple moved from the 30-pin iPod connector to Lightning on the iPhone 5. Here is everything to expect from the event, based on Bloombergs reporting and people familiar with the companys plans:
