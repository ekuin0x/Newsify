                Ukraine is gaining ground in its counteroffensive started in June claimed NATO SecretaryGeneral Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday addressing lawmakers at the European Parliament Does that mean Ukraine has finally achieved a breakthrough after nearly four months and heavy casualties To answer that question we have to know what the goals and objectives of the current phase of the Ukrainian counteroffensive are Scott Ritter a military analyst and former US Marine Corps intelligence officer told Sputnik

document script Rumble Rumbleplay videov3d063kdivrumble_v3d063k We know that when they initiated this counteroffensive back in early June of this year the goals were quite clear to break through the first line of Russian defenses the second line of Russian defenses seize the town of Tokmak and then use that as a launching point to penetrate deeper through the Russian defenses to seize the city of Melitopol which would enable them to sever the land bridge between Crimea and Russia and bring Crimea under direct attack That was the stated objective put forward by General Zaluzhny echoed by President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials the military expert continued However these objectives have not been reached so far per Ritter Presently the Ukrainians are claiming that they have put infantry units beyond the socalled  dragons teeth  the concrete obstacles that constitute the first line of Russias defenses In particular the Kiev regime says its forces managed to take the villages of Verbovoye and Rabotino in the Zaporozhye region Still the Russian Ministry of Defense made it clear on September 7 and 8 that the Russian forces are continuing to successfully repel attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the areas of the settlements As Russian military blogger Rybar remarked on his Telegram account its the best way to turn Rabotino into a continuous conveyor of death for Ukrainian units The village of Rabotino was always meant to fall If the Ukrainians put sufficient military power in a specific zone of operations they should be able to advance and seize terrain that the Russians have decided will be defended but not to the death Rabotino was always meant to be part of the crumple zone in the fire element defensive zone of the first line of defense The purpose of Rabotino was to help break up the Ukrainian attacks and it has done this magnificently said Ritter  context httpschemaorg type ImageObject url

Teeth Defense 6 September 1559 GMT Whats Russias New Defensive Doctrine Whats actually going on in Rabotino and Verbovoe is part of a new Russian defensive doctrine  explains the former Marine intelligence officer Russia always had a primarily defensive doctrine inherited from the Soviet times But this new defensive doctrine thats being implemented especially in the Zaporozhye front is the brainchild of Lieutenant General Alexander Romanchuck former deputy commander I believe of the 58th Combined Arms Army He was sent to the Combined Arms Academy after participating in the early phases of the Special Military Operation While he was at the Combined Arms Academy he rewrote Russian defensive doctrine and then he was brought out of the Combined Arms Academy and given a leadership position in the Zapporozhye front in the Rabotino area Scott Ritter former US Marine Corps intelligence officer In accordance with the doctrine the purpose of the forward defensive zone is to receive an enemy attack to help break it up to use defensive belts minefields obstacles what they call fire cauldrons or sacks where you want to force the enemy to come in so you can hit them with artillery to break up the attack but not to hold and die explained Ritter That is as the enemy presses forward the idea is to minimize your own losses by withdrawing back to prepared positions and continuing to bring the enemy under increasing levels of firepower from the air from artillery from antitank guided missiles etc all the while bogging them down with minefields other obstacles The first line of defense is not meant to be the Alamo Thats a reference to an American battle back in 1836 when the Mexican army stormed a Texan defensive position the Alamo and the Texan defenders fought and died there Thats not what the Russians are doing Once Ukrainians achieve localized superiority Russians will withdraw and continue to grind the enemy forces further  The irony of the situation according to Ritter is that the first line of defense is meant to be broken by the Ukrainians at a time and place determined not by the Ukrainians but by the Russians whove been shaping the battlefield from the outset of Kievs botched counteroffensive Even if the Ukrainians have succeeded in penetrating the first line of Russias defense this is done by design This is not the final battle They would still need to exploit this breach Move on to the second line of defense where theyll come under even increasing intensity of attack That is even if the Ukrainian military takes a couple of villages here and there it does not mean any breakthrough but rather a beginning of the end of Kievs counteroffensive  context httpschemaorg type ImageObject url

Munitions Proven Effective Amid Ukraine Counteroffensive Yesterday 1839 GMT Why is Russias First Line of Defense a Death Trap Russia has forced the Ukrainian military to burn through their reserves and ammunition while storming the first line of defense according to Ritter This is what we need to understand At this point in the fight Ukraine has committed its strategic reserve the final core three brigades that they had been holding back This was the exploitation force This was the force that was supposed to be committed into the battle when the town of Tokmak which is behind the second line of defense fell to the Ukrainians This was the force that was supposed to push through the Russian defenses and seize the city of Melitopol completing the objective The strategic reserve is being committed because the initial wave of the attack the followon attack have all failed to break through the defensive zone in front of the first line of defense Exhausted by struggling to overcome Russias defense lines the Ukrainians will have no strength left to push on forward said Ritter This is part of Alexander Romanchucks defensive concept and its been executed perfectly by the Russians at Rabotino he stressed  context httpschemaorg type ImageObject url httpscdn1imgsputnikglobecomimg07e706191111458180_038332101667_640x0_80_0_0_edc24fdef57b2a3d54731ce71136f52fjpg thumbnail   type

Washington 6 September 1748 GMT Why are Ukrainians Pushing Forward Despite Failing to Make Progress This is a political question that can only be answered by the Ukrainians said Ritter Per the military analyst Kiev wants to demonstrate to the West that the billions of dollars of assistance have not been given in vain and that if Ukraine asks for military assistance  it will effectively use this military assistance to further not only Ukrainian objectives but NATOs objectives as well However the problem here is that Kiev and NATOs objectives arent necessarily identical the US military veteran highlighted While Ukraines objectives include the physical reconquest of territory Ukraine believes belongs to it NATOs goal is not so much about achieving decisive military victory on the battlefield but to inflict pain on Russia to an extent that there could be a Moscow Maidan akin to one that happened in Kiev in 2014 Ritter explained NATO and we hear this over and over again in the rhetoric of American politicians whether it be Senator Lindsey Graham or we have Nikki Haley running for office we have others out there echoing the same thing that the expenditure of US taxpayer money in support of Ukraine is money wellspent because were killing Russians and no Americans are dying Now whats left out of this perverse equation is the Ukrainians who are dying But for the United States and NATO it simply doesnt matter One should bear in mind that NATO isnt here to help Ukraine achieve a military victory NATOs here to use Ukrainian lives as chips in a gambling game designed to hurt the Russians the military expert emphasized  context httpschemaorg type ImageObject url

August 1200 GMT Who is to Blame for Ukraines Failing Counteroffensive While one cannot absolve Ukraine of its responsibility for the unfolding havoc  given that Volodymyr Zelensky could have ended the conflict back in March 2022 following RussoUkrainian peace talks in Istanbul  one cannot absolve NATO either according to Ritter Let me make it clear here This counteroffensive was never going to work Ever General Christopher Cavoli the commander of US forces in Europe and the Supreme Allied Commander of ground forces when he spoke to a Swedish Defense Forum in January of this year spoke of the conflict taking place this was a precounteroffensive conflict prebattle of Bakhmut conflict he said the scope and scale of the violence taking place in Ukraine today is beyond the imagination of NATO  So when he says that whats happening in Ukraine is beyond the imagination of NATO it means hes saying that NATO is not prepared for this kind of war and NATO isnt prepared for this kind of war Per the former Marine intelligence officer the crux of the matter is that the Pentagon and NATO commanders have never conducted combined arms warfare in their career having spent the last 20 years involved in lowintensity conflict operations in Iraq Afghanistan Syria and elsewhere As a result American officials NATO officials American officers NATO officers are trying to teach Ukrainians about a doctrine  combined arms warfare  which they themselves are not masters of  context httpschemaorg type ImageObject url

Wont Turn the Tide in Ukraine Yesterday 1657 GMT The answer is NATO itself has a paper tiger that for the last 20 years has not been funded properly They havent been training properly Theyve not been doing the right kind of defense procurement properly And theres not a single military today thats healthy enough to carry out the kind of combat thats taking place in Ukraine let alone transfer equipment to the Ukrainian military that could assist them in doing this kind of warfare Insufficient training Ukraines change of military doctrine and style of weaponry in midrace and lack of resources also contributed to Kievs defeats according to the military expert The Ukrainians are just not up to the task NATO knew it And so therefore at the end of the day the majority of the blame goes to NATO for encouraging Ukraine to do something that NATO knew Ukraine couldnt accomplish But again I come back to what I said before NATO doesnt want Ukraine to win on the battlefield They just want Ukraine to hurt the Russians enough to get Russia to quit  context httpschemaorg type ImageObject url

Got First Taste of Combat in Ukraine  and Failed 5 September 1850 GMT Whats the End Game Ritter noted that Ukraines botched counteroffensive appears to have brought NATO commanders from their fantasy world  in which Russia is weak and its military is failing  back to the ground  I think whats happening with this counteroffensive failing right now is that the reality is being changed in the Pentagon For the first time youre starting to hear Pentagon officials talk about Russian competence Theyre acknowledging grudgingly but acknowledging that the Russians have prepared a very effective defense They give most of the credit to mines trees and shrubs Thats serious Thats what they were saying But the reality is the Russians are not yielding I mean if one only takes a look at the example of the Alyosha tank that famous tank that charged forward one against eight and then sort of a legend has appeared around it Look at the composition of troops contract soldiers volunteers mobilize troops coming together and operating with dedication with a sense of selfsacrifice with discipline with courage The Russians turned out to be very good and this fact disrupted NATOs gambit according to Ritter He noted that theres a whole new reality setting in in the West about the impossibility of achieving their goals and objectives in Ukraine and now the West is facing a dilemma of how to mitigate the consequences of the imminent defeat If you stop the conflict now we can pretty much define what the borders are going to look like But if you allow this conflict to go forward the question of what the final configuration of the Ukrainian state is up in the air And so I think in the West right now theres a lot of talk about how do we get ourselves out of this But it has to be done in a way that doesnt pull the rug totally out from under the feet of the Ukrainians Because if you get too far ahead and when talking about the capitulation as the endgame theres not much left for the Ukrainian troops to fight And you might find that collapse will be the endgame Ritter concluded  context httpschemaorg type ImageObject url
