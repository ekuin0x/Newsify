                Traffic is gridlocked in Tunbridge Wells this morning (September 13) after an oil spillage closed the main route through the town centre. Drivers were left sitting in long queues as the spillage was cleared - and the wider road network continues to be hit by congestion. Kent Police and teams from Kent County Council 's highways team said they dealt with the spillage on Vale Road and Mount Pleasant Road, which were closed. Teams spread sand along the roads and onto the busy roundabout. The photo above shows sand also in Grove Hill Road, which joins the roundabout. The spillage also saw the top of the High Street closed.

A council spokesperson added: "Highways officers used sand on the affected part of the road, which has now reopened." The council said it believed the oil spill was from a leak caused by hydraulic equipment operated by Network Rail. KentLive has gone to Network Rail for comment.
