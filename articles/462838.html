                Patrick Kielty has promised never to sing on The Late Late Show  after Radiohead took him to task for butchering their 90s classic Creep. The Co Down native will take up the reins on the worlds longest running chat show with his first live episode next Friday, September 15. But Kielty , 52, wont be taking up the mic and singing the theme tune himself, something he did when presenting Last Chance Lottery on Channel 4 three decades ago. READ MORE - Patrick Kielty steps out on red carpet for new film to debut same night as Late Late Show He told the Irish Sunday Mirror: "I definitely will not be inflicting that on the audience. I remember somebody interviewing Radiohead shortly after that. "They were saying that they were so embarrassed. Who was this guy thats just murdered our magnificent song? "So no, that will not be making a comeback. I will not be singing on The Late Late Show." RTE, Ryan Tubridy and The Late Late Show have dominated the headlines since late June when details of a payments scandal began to emerge. But Kielty, who made public his 250,000 yearly fee for the gig, insisted he does not feel any added pressure or that hes caught in the eye of a storm not of his making. He said: "Weirdly no. Its funny just keeping your head down. I dont really know what people are saying. "Im excited. Id be lying if I didnt say that Im a tiny bit nervous as we get towards the first show. "But I think with stand up, theres that thing that you always get, which is just before you go on and youre standing in the wings, and theres always that nervous energy. "I think nerves are good, because nerves always turn into excitement. They also turn into adrenaline... helps you get through it and helps you get the craic going." Speculation has been rife since RTE put out a call for tickets for the new season, hinting at a new format and more interaction from the audience. The comedian and actor said: "Im sort of hoping to go for a Patrick Kielty-style show if thats not too bold to suggest. "Its the tone and the vibe that you create. As youre the host, youre the person that kind of sets out the party for the audience and for the guests. "I think The Late Late show has to do different things to pretty much every other talk show. Like if you look at Graham [Norton]s show, thats very much just purely entertainment focused. "I think thats what makes The Late Late Show unique and brilliant and an institution in the fact that it can segue from craic, to fun, to politics to something serious to heres a song to heres a moment that the country is sharing. "I think its important then for me to try to weave who I am and how I react to all of those things and weave myself into the stitching." Serious content will still feature because, Patrick says, that is what makes the show unique. He added: "This show has not been done anywhere else in the world because it reflects an Irish state of mind. "It reflects the way that Irish people talk, the way that we value story, the way that we value interaction, the way that we can segue from, Oh my god, thats so funny." Details on the next instalment of a TV institution, The Late Late Toy Show, are equally scant, but Kielty, who is dad to Milo, seven, and five-year-old James, seems to have his priorities straight. He said: "My stamp on the Toy Show is that the only stars of that show are the kids. "No matter what you try or what plans you have once the kids are involved, theyre going to make the moments, the laughter. And my whole thing is just go with the flow." But the possibility of co-hosting with wife Cat Deeley, who he married in 2012, is quickly dismissed. He said: "I wouldnt think theres any plans for Cat to co-host. "The co-hosting is limited to what happens across the breakfast table at home, trying to sort our two and get them out of the house for school and football and all the rest. "I took the eldest fella to Croke Park this year for the first time. He loved that and you know Im bringing him to Man United at the weekend. "So when people ask, Are you busy with the show? Im like, No, Im coming into work to get a break." Kielty said he hasnt spoken to Tubridy, who quit the Late Late after 14 years in May and was publicly dumped from his RTE radio show last month. He said: I havent spoken to Ryan, I havent spoken to Pat Kenny or any of the previous hosts. "I think its important, whenever you take a gig like this, that you choose your own course and you make your own show. "Until youre part of the club of actually hosting the show, I dont really think you should be chatting to anybody. Once you do, then you can maybe compare notes." Describing the payments scandal and resulting negative publicity for RTE as "unwanted background noise" he said he plans to waive his expenses "right the way through". He added: "People needed to get to the bottom of all of that, but it really wasnt my business. "For me, the joy of this has never changed. The fact I was offered that show, emotionally it was always a yes. "Walking out on the 15th [of September] thats my business and thinking about it every day still puts a smile on my face. "I havent worked for RTE before in my life. Meeting everybody for the first time... the team that make this show are like a crack commando team. "Ive had two or three moments in the building with people telling me theyre really delighted Im here and asking me if theres anything they can do to help me, its been really lovely." Asked one thing about him that we dont know, he replied: "I really love country music. I cannot wait until the Country Special. Everyones going, What about the Toy Show. Im going, Im really looking forward to the Toy Show but the Country Special..."
