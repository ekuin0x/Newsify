                The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has not ruled out legal action against former Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter, holding him to account for commissioning an "unauthorised" investigation into corruption at the power utility. "The former CEO did not have authority to investigate the affairs of Eskom and it does appear that he had a distrust of law enforcement agencies. As the CEO, it was incumbent on him to raise the distrust appropriately but he commissioned a parallel investigation," SIU head Lekgoa Mothibi told Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts on Tuesday. "Consideration should be given to holding the former CEO to account It becomes a legal question as he is no longer employed by Eskom, and in this regard, we will consider the options that are available, together with the board, and advise accordingly." The investigation unit is considering formally reaching out to De Ruyter, who is currently working as a fellow at Yale University, as part of that process. News24 previously reported that De Ruyter authorised an intelligence investigation by the former police commissioner George Fivaz's forensic firm, George Fivaz Forensic and Risk (GFFR).The operation was funded privately, including by Business Leadership South Africa. "GFFR conducted an unauthorised investigation into Eskom. The unauthorised nature of the investigation needs to be dealt with. However, it does contain information that is useful," Mothibi said, adding that De Ruyter's behaviour in the matter, including not consulting stakeholders was maladministration, "despite his good intent." De Ruyter left Eskom in February, a month earlier than scheduled, after a bombshell television interview on eNCA, in which he made accusations of political involvement and endemic corruption at Eskom. He also published a tell-all book on his time at Eskom. Eskom board chair Mpho Makwana previously told Scopa that the board's governance teams were reviewing all the evidence and would ensure that the board "takes all necessary action". At a previous Scopa meeting former Eskom chairperson Malegapuru Makgoba told MPs that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan had suggested to De Ruyter "that he gather more information" after being told of a conspiracy to undermine Eskom. Gordhan has emphatically denied this, saying that he first heard about the intelligence-gathering operation six months into the contract.
