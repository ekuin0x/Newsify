Accordingly, the global car finance market has been considerably affected. However, the overall situation is gradually being ameliorated across the world and the market is expected to get back to its position soon. At the same time, it's worth mentioning that people across the world have started preferring private way of transportation over selecting public transport which, in turn, has provided the market with a mixed effect. The banks segment to lead the trail by 2027- Based on distribution channel, the banks segment accounted for nearly two-fifths of the global car finance market share in 2019 and is anticipated to maintain the lion's share throughout the study period.

Simultaneously, the used vehicles would manifest the fastest CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2027, owing to rise in demand for used cars with customized models, limited budget for availing car loans, and changing business preferences toward vehicles.
