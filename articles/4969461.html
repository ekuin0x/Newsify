                Apple unveiled its latest iPhone 15 lineup on Tuesday. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro pre-orders started this Friday, and the first deliveries are slated for September 22. However, alongside these new releases, Apple has decided to discontinue the iPhone 13 Mini, signaling the permanent end of its Mini version. According to , discontinuing the iPhone Mini series has been a gradual process that commenced last year. Apple introduced the iPhone 14 series without a successor to the iPhone 13 Mini. However, the Mini remained available alongside the rest of the iPhone 13 series throughout most of 2023, and it was still offered as a new device by Apple until the recent unveiling of the iPhone 15. With the absence of the Mini in the iPhone 15 series and the removal of the iPhone 13 Mini from Apple's retail lineup, it is evident that the era of the compact iPhone has come to a definitive end. The discontinuation of the iPhone 12 Mini coincided with the release of the iPhone 14, leaving the iPhone 13 Mini as the sole remaining compact flagship choice. Apple has faced challenges selling smaller phones because most consumers prefer larger smartphone models, particularly in this region. However, there is a silver lining in the fact that phone manufacturers seem to have moved away from the trend of constantly increasing screen sizes, at least when it comes to conventional slab-style phones. Large phones have maintained a consistent size over the past few years, and the slight reduction in size with the 15 Pro is an encouraging development. The industry may have recognized the 6.1-inch screen as a comfortable middle ground. Alternatively, display manufacturers could be directing their efforts toward folding screen technology. reported that Apple compact smartphones come with certain limitations. Their batteries tend to be smaller, resulting in a reduced battery life, especially if you engage in power-intensive activities throughout the day. Over time, as the battery ages, it may struggle to hold a full charge, exacerbating this issue. Additionally, smaller phones may not provide the most immersive viewing or gaming experience for users who prefer larger screens. Apple's inventory currently includes only one iPhone model with a screen size below 6 inches, the 3rd generation iPhone SE featuring a 4.7-inch LCD screen. Apple is maintaining the availability of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 as more affordable alternatives to the iPhone 15. The iPhone 12 has also been phased out and replaced by the iPhone 13, which now comes at a reduced price. However, reported that there are speculations circulating that the forthcoming iPhone SE iteration will adopt a larger display, aligning with the prevailing consumer preference for larger smartphones.
