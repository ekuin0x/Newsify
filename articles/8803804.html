                Selena Gomez's reaction to Chris Brown nomination goes VIRAL: Singer sneers at the mention of disgraced rapper at MTV Video Music Awards Brown was nominated for Best R&B for his cameo on Chloe Bailey 's song How Does It Feel (although he was not in attendance) The Only Murders In The Building actress emphatically scrunched her nose in seeming disapproval Her reaction to the mention of his name quickly went viral By Ashleigh Gray For Dailymail.Com Published: 08:32, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 11:21, 13 September 2023 e-mail 227 shares 88 View comments Selena Gomez was caught reacting to Chris Brown 's 2023 MTV Video Music Award nomination during Tuesday night's live broadcast. The 30-year-old multihyphenate  who won the Best Afrobeats award with Rema  was recorded sneering after the 34-year-old R&B crooner's name was mentioned. Brown was nominated for Best R&B for his cameo on Chloe Bailey 's song How Does It Feel. As the presenter named the Virginia-bred music artist, the Only Murders In The Building actress emphatically scrunched her nose in seeming disapproval. The award went to SZA for her song Shirt, prompting another visceral reaction from Gomez, who appeared disappointed that the songstress wasn't at the show to accept her award in person. Viral!

'Selena Gomez's reaction to Chris Brown is SO FUNNY,' the tweet to its 187,500 followers read. It comes after last month singer Ciara caught flack from fans for working with him on her new song How We Roll. Critics flooded her social media comments to condemn her for working with the 'toxic' hitmaker despite his violent past  which includes physically abusing Rihanna in 2009. He was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats but avoided jail time by accepting a plea deal. Last November Kelly Rowland defended Chris when he was booed after winning Best Male R&B Artist at the American Music Awards, which he was not present for. At the time she said 'we all need to be forgiven' while scolding the crowd. Kelly later told TMZ : 'I believe that grace is very real, we all need a dose of it. Before we point fingers at anyone we should realize how grateful we are, for every moment that we get.' Not a fan?

There was also internet buzz about Selena's reaction to Olivia Rodrigo's performance Winners! Rema and Selena accepted the brand new Afro Beats award for their collaboration on the remix of Rema's song Calm Down In the early hours of February 8, 2009, he got into an argument with Rihanna that ended with him assaulting her badly enough to require her hospitalization. He was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats the following month, initially pleading not guilty, before pleading guilty to a single felony count. He was ordered to serve five years of probation, community service and counseling for domestic violence. The two later reunited in early 2013, before breaking up again later that year. In addition to giving his former partner a busted lip and painful black eye during a fight when she was 21, he most recently was accused of raping and drugging a woman aboard a yacht in 2020, which he has vehemently denied. Controversy: In the early hours of February 8, 2009, he got into an argument with Rihanna that ended with him assaulting her badly enough to require her hospitalization; the former couple are seen in February 2013 Airing live in more than 150 countries, the global production spotlighted the best music videos of the past year with performances, tributes and fashion-forward appearances from music industry heavy hitters. A new award category was introduced this year titled Show of the Summer, and fans got to decide who takes home the moon man prize. Shakira received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, and hip-hop icon Diddy received the Global Icon Award. This year, the list of Artist of the Year contenders was entirely comprised of female artists for the first time, with Taylor Swift leading with the most nominations.
