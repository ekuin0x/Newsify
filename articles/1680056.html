                Keeping up with the love lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family: As Kylie confirms her unexpected relationship with Timothee Chalamet, a look at the sisters' off-brand romances By Codie Bullen For Mailonline Published: 15:58 BST, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 17:24 BST, 10 September 2023 e-mail 118 View comments With constant relationship drama in the Kardashian-Jenner clan, it can be hard to keep track of whose with who. And sisters Kourtney, Kim, Khlo, Kylie and Kendall have had their fair share of off-brand romances through out the years. The latest unexpected relationship was confirmed this week when Kylie shared a kiss with her new man Timothee Chalamet . Timothee held Kylie from behind as she grooved and danced about as they watched Beyonce perform in Los Angeles . As the pair make it official, MailOnline takes a look at all of the Kardashian romances that took us by surprise. Ex: Kim and Pete split in August 2022 after a whirlwind nine month relationship Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson Kim and Pete split in August 2022 after a whirlwind nine month relationship. The reality star, 42, and comedian, 29, proved to be one of the most unlikely Hollywood couples after first sparking romance rumours on the set of Saturday Night Live. Kim, alongside her then husband Kanye West, first met Pete as they enjoyed a swanky dinner at Nobu Malibu to celebrate rapper and mutual friend Kid Cudi's 35th birthday Kim and Pete first set tongues wagging during her Saturday Night Live episode last October, locking lips during an Aladdin-themed sketch. News broke shortly thereafter that they had become a couple in real life - months after Kim filed for divorce from Kanye, who by last autumn was publicly begging her to give the marriage another chance. Throwback: The reality star, 42, and comedian, 29, proved to be one of the most unlikely Hollywood couples after first sparking romance rumours on the set of Saturday Night Live The couple make their first official red carpet debut at the Met Gala where they ran into each other a year earlier. Sources confirm the couple have split after nine months, with their busy schedules and work commitments reportedly to blame. News of their split came after a source told People that the 'long distance hasn't been easy for Kim'. An insider has now explained to E! News : 'They have a lot of love and respect for each other, but found that the long distance and their demanding schedules made it really difficult to maintain a relationship.' Kim joined a long list of Pete's ex celebrity girlfriends, including Andie MacDowell's daughter Margaret Qualley and Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia Gerber, as well as Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale and Phoebe Dynevor. Couple: Kourtney and Travis made headlines when they became romantically involved in late 2020 after nearly a decade of friendship Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker Kourtney and heavily tattooed drummer Travis made headlines when they became romantically involved in late 2020 after being close friends for ten years. They made their relationship Instagram official in February 2021 and were engaged by that October. The couple wed at a courthouse in Santa Barbara in May 2022 before jetting off to Portofino, Italy a week later to hold a lavish wedding at the Dolce & Gabbana mansion in front of their friends and family. Kourtney has been open with fans about her attempts to conceive a child with husband Travis Barker through in vitro fertilization. Sweet: The couple are now expecting their first child together, with Kourtney announcing the news as the Blink-182 drummer performed on stage at his concert In 2022, Kourtney first detailed her struggle with IVF on Hulu's The Kardashians. Kourtney revealed last December that she'd officially stopped her IVF journey 10 months prior after she said it caused her to spiral into a deep depression among other symptoms. The couple are now expecting their first child together, with Kourtney announcing the news as the Blink-182 drummer performed on stage at his concert. She already shares three children  Mason, 13, Penelope, 10, and Reign, eight  with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, 39. Travis has two children  Landon, 19, and Alabama, 17  with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, 48. Rumours: It was reported back in December 2015 that the Kardashian star had started hooking up with Justin Bieber Kourtney Kardashian and Justin Bieber It was reported back in December 2015 that the Kardashian star had started hooking up with Justin Bieber. The duo were first spotted out in December 2015 at West Hollywood hotspot The Nice Guy. Then in January 2017, Kourtney and Justin were spotted together at the Peppermint Club in West Hollywood, once again fueling romance rumors. Still sources claimed that despite the hook-up rumours, they were just good friends with a source stating, 'Kourtney wouldn't go there.' Justin addressed the rumours in 2015, telling The Bert Show: 'I'm being used, man. What can I say?...No, no, but for real, she's great. I've known [the family] for years.' Justin is now married to wife Hailey Bieber. Romance: Kendall and Bad Bunny have been romantically linked since February this year Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny Kendall and Bad Bunny have been romantically linked since February this year. The pair have been spotted together a number of times in the months since then, stepping out for dinner, taking in a Lakers playoff game, going horseback riding, and cozying up at the Coachella Music Festival. Last week, a source told People that the relationship between them is 'getting serious,' as they vacationed at a resort in Idaho. 'They definitely seem in love, and super serious,' the source said. 'They're really friendly. Kendall is so low key that plenty of guests don't even know who she was.' Kendall last dated the NBA star Devin Booker. In November 2022, they were reported to have quietly broken up the previous month. The breakup was attributed to their busy and conflicting schedules at the time. However, following the reports of Kendall and Bad Bunny's initial hookup, she and Devin appeared to unfollow each other on Instagram. New couple: Earlier this month it was confirmed that Kylie and Timothe are still in a relationship, despite rumors that he had 'dumped' the mom-of-two Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet Earlier this month it was confirmed that Kylie and Timothe are still in a relationship, despite rumors that he had 'dumped' the mom-of-two. They have been quietly dating since early April and have not broken up, TMZ reported. Their sources denied the report that was circulating that the movie star 'dumped' Kylie. The stars are still 'an item' and 'any reports that say otherwise are false,' their insiders said. Kylie and Timothe were first linked romantically in April via celebrity gossip account DeuxMoi, after a tipster wrote in. They are said to have sparked up a romance after they both attended the Jean-Paul Gaultier fashion show on January 25, 2023. And the pair were not shy about displaying their affection for one another as they finally went public with their romance. The couple could hardly keep their hands - and lips - off each other as they watched Beyonce perform in Los Angeles on Monday. Kylie, 26, and Timothee, 27, were caught exchanging multiple kisses as they watched Beyonce in each other's arms. Loved-up: The pair were not shy about displaying their affection for one another as they finally went public with their romance Elsewhere at the concert, Kylie's ex-boyfriend Tyga was also spotted at the show. Timothee held Kylie from behind as she grooved and danced about in a fitted mini dress with thigh-high boots and her hair slicked back into a messy bun. The actor peppered her with kisses before they eventually alternated places, with Kylie holding onto Timothee from behind as he held her hand. Kylie shares two children with ex-partner Travis Scott: daughter Stormi, five, and Aire, one. They started dating in 2017, welcoming Stormi in the following year. The couple split in October 2019 but reunited in February 2020, before split again during the holidays in December 2022. Meanwhile Timothe has been linked to Lily-Rose Depp, Eiza Gonzalez and Lourdes Leon. Be the first to comment Be one of the first to comment Comments Have we missed any?
