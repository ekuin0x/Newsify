                A multi-million dollar home in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood was burglarized this week — the third forced entry police have investigated at the property within the past 22 months. Shortly after 8:30 p.m. Thursday, police said two burglars entered a house on the 00 block of Crescent Drive. The duo broke the glass of a locked rear door, which triggered a home security alarm and woke a woman and her husband who were sleeping inside. The two people — wearing black hooded sweatshirts, face masks and gloves — fled after the woman, who is in her 70s, yelled at them from upstairs, according to police. The race and gender of the burglars is unknown, and no arrests have been made. As of Friday, the victims were unsure if anything was stolen. Police said the two prior burglaries — reported in November 2021 and February 2022 — are still open and unsolved. Without any leads for the people responsible for the break-ins, authorities are unsure if the home has been intentionally targeted. On all three occasions, burglars entered the residence by breaking the locked back doors’ glass The property is located on a short, crescent-shaped street just off of University Avenue, a high-traffic throughway that leads to Stanford University. Neighboring homes in the area — less than one mile southwest of Highway 101 — range in value from $2 million to $11 million, according to Zillow listings. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the 24-hour dispatch center at (650) 329-2413. Anonymous tips can be e-mailed to paloalto@tipnow.org or sent via text message or voice mail to (650) 383-8984.
