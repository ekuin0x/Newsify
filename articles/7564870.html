By Max Carter Keall For Mailonline Published: 10:21 BST, 9 September 2023 | Updated: 11:25 BST, 9 September 2023 e-mail 18 View comments Jenni Hermoso was pictured back in training with Mexican club CF Pachuca for the first time after filing a legal complaint against Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales for kissing her without consent. Hermoso is accusing Rubiales of sexual assault over an unsolicited kiss after the Women's World Cup Final, and her club Pachuca have pomised to help her find 'normality'. Las Tuzas play against Pumas on Sunday in round ten of the the Apertura tournament. It is unknown whether Hermoso will feature for the side in the game, but the pictures showing her back with the team were released on Pachuca's official Instagram. CF Pachuca released the photos on the club's official Instagram account as Hermoso returns The club have pledged to make her return as normal as possible after the unsolicited kiss View this post on Instagram A post shared by Club Pachuca Femenil (@tuzasoficial) Your browser does not support iframes. After a long career in Europe with spells at Barcelona, PSG and Atlético Madrid, Hermoso joined Pachuca last summer. The forward was prolific across to spell at Barcelona and knotched 18 goals in 20 games last season to help Pachuca reach the final, ultimately losing to club America earlier this year. Las Tuzas are currently in 10th place among 18 teams in the first division after nine rounds. Spanish state prosecutors have filed the lawsuit against Rubiales for sexual assault and coercion, and there is an ongoing inquiry by Spain's top sport court for "serious misconduct", as well as an investigation by FIFA which has provisionally suspended him. The former president could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty of sexual assault, under recently passed law. In a statement last month, Hermoso said the incident had left her feeling “vulnerable and a victim of aggression”. She described the kiss as an “impulsive act, sexist, out of place and without any type of consent from my part”. Rubiales has insisted the kiss was consensual however Hermoso has denied that in statements issued by her and her players' union. Prosecutors have asked the National Court judge that Rubiales appear before a court to give preliminary testimony. Luis Rubiales unconsentually kissed Hermoso during the medal presentation after the final Spain boss Jorge Vilda was sacked on Tuesday but has since labelled his dismissal as 'unfair' A formal court investigation will follow, if the judge agrees the hear the case, and it would end with a recommendation for the case to either be dismissed or go to trial Prosecutors had given Hermoso, 33, a time span of 15 days to accuse Rubiales of sexually assaulting her by kissing her on the lips without consent. She did so on Wednesday, filing the complaint in person at the Spanish State Prosecution Service HQ in Madrid. Without it, state prosecutors would have been unable to prosecute Rubiales. Rubiales mother was admitted to hospital after going on a three-day hunger strike in protest to the treatment of her son. Spanish media reported that Rubiales had personally come to collect his mother in the early hours of Thursday morning and they had slipped away through a back exit. Meanwhile, World Cup winning Spain coach Jorge Vilda was sacked on Tuesday after his involvement in the ongoing scandal following Rubiales actions on presenting the Spanish Women's team with their World Cup winners' medals. Vilda has sinced labelled his sacking as 'unfair' and said he would never applaud anything sexist, or contrary to the fight for equality, despite being seen clapping suspended Spanish FA president Luis Rubiales, after claiming he was the victim of a 'political and media lynching'. Jenni Hermoso was given a warm welcome by teammates after returning for the first time Las Tuzas are sitting in tenth place among the 18 teams in the first division after nine rounds Hermoso celebrating Spain's World Cup victory after narrowly beating England 1-0 in the final IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!
