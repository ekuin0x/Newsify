                Andy Farrells men launched their campaign by running in 12 tries during a thumping 82-8 demolition of Pool B minnows Romania. Ireland have pivotal Paris appointments against South Africa and Scotland on the horizon but feel they cannot afford to underestimate the nation sitting 15th in the Test rankings. Theyve got some of the best open field runners in world rugby, defence coach Simon Easterby said of Tonga. Theyve got guys in the forward pack that can mix it, they can offload. And theyve got attacking threats throughout their back line. Its a real challenge for us defensively, its one that were probably ready for after the Romania game. We didnt have to get through that much work without the ball. Its going to be a big step up from the challenge Romania threw at us. Tonga are ready to kick off their journey   Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) They (Tonga) attack well but they certainly want to come and hit and put us off our rhythm. Head coach Farrell spoke of focusing on immediate challenges and respecting Tonga, who are preparing for their opening match of the tournament, when announcing a strong team on Thursday afternoon. Aside from sidelined hooker Dan Sheehan and first-choice scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park, the Englishman has gone with arguably his preferred starting XV, which features four personnel changes from last weekend. Full-back Hugo Keenan feels it is easy to concentrate game by game, despite the looming threat of the Springboks. Captain's Run in Nantes!   Irish Rugby (@IrishRugby) Yeah, I think it has (been), he said. I know throughout the pool, there is tough games coming up but Tonga are a serious side, serious threats and individuals across the team. Were only looking at them, were only focusing on this week. Following the scorching conditions of their Bordeaux curtain-raiser, where temperatures reached 36 degrees Celsius, Ireland trained in 30-degree heat on Friday afternoon at Stade de la Beaujoire. Prop Tadhg Furlong joked about needing to layer up as he prepares for a stern test against Tongas bulky front-row forwards. I was thinking of putting a jumper on today compared to what weve been used to, he said. Although it is hot, it doesnt feel as hot (as previously). (Its been) like an oven, or someone blowing a hairdryer in your face, for the last few weeks. Referring to the weekend challenge, he said: Of course we respect them. Sometimes in scrummaging theres no replacement for displacement. Weight makes it heavy, it makes it hard, thats the nature of it and its a big challenge from a big pack. We have to be technically good.
