                Shah Rukh Khan made a massive comeback in January 2023 with his film . The actor returned to the big screen after four long years, and the audience flocked to the theatres to finally watch him. The movie eventually went on to break records at the box office. The film collected over Rs 1000 crore at the box office globally. Now, SRK's second film after his comeback, , has released in theatres. The film is already breaking records set by at the box office. The movie is receiving massive love from the audience and is expected to become the highest-grossing movie of the year. However, it seems that the massive success of the two films has affected the release date of his third film, . According to a Koimoi report, the makers of are debating whether they should release the film this year or not. The film was reportedly supposed to hit theatres in December of this year. A source close to the development told the website that the makers are looking at the possibility of moving to early next year. The source added that after two back-to-back hits, a third movie in the same year would make no sense. The source further stated that SRK fans need some time to absorb the massive twin successes. The person stated that Jawan is still in theatres and won't be releasing on OTT before November; hence, the SRK fever will continue until the end of the year. The source also shared that if releases this year, SRK will not have any films scheduled for next year. For now, there is no official confirmation from the production house about the postponement.
