                Its flu shot season again, but depending on your age and health, you may want to roll up your sleeve three times this fall in hopes of staving off respiratory viruses. Shots to reduce the odds of severe influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, already are available in clinics around Colorado, and an updated COVID-19 booster is expected to start arriving over the next week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Last season in Colorado, COVID-19 hospitalized 8,231 people, while flu hospitalized 3,076 between October and May. Statewide data on RSV hospitalizations isnt collected, but 2,597 people were admitted for it in the Denver area. Doctors are , but predicting how viruses will behave is always fraught. In the last few weeks, Colorado has been seeing more cases of COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, though the season hasnt started in earnest yet, said Dr. Amy Duckro, executive director of population health at Kaiser Permanente Colorado. While people may be tired of thinking about viruses, its a good idea to get any shots youre eligible for and to recommit to handwashing and staying home if youre sick, she said. Its very understandable that there was a lot of fatigue around getting the COVID vaccine, she said. I would urge everyone to reconsider. The recommendations are simplest for flu: anyone six months and older should get the shot to reduce their risk of severe illness. The only people in that age group who shouldnt get the flu shot are those whove had a severe allergic reaction to it in the past. Similarly, for COVID-19, the that anyone six months and older get an updated shot from Pfizer or Moderna  if its been at least two months since their last dose. Novavaxs updated shot is still under review. People who recently had the virus can choose whether to get the shot immediately or to wait. Babies and toddlers may need more than one shot, if they werent already fully vaccinated. Adults 60 and older can get either of two new vaccines approved to prevent symptoms of RSV. The CDC didnt issue a recommendation that all older adults should get those vaccines, though, because of the possibility of rare side effects. Instead, it recommended that older adults talk to their doctors about how much risk they would face from RSV, and if getting the shot makes sense for them. A monoclonal antibody product  essentially a lab-made version of the substances the body produces to fight infections  will also be available in the near future to protect infants from RSV. Its recommended for all babies under eight months, and those between eight and 19 months who have risk factors for severe disease. That wont be certain until further into the season, but most of the currently circulating variants of COVID-19 are close to XBB.1.5, the subvariant that was chosen to make the new boosters. Researchers expect its going to be a . No one knows which flu strains will be dominant this year, but that shot is well-matched to the ones that circulated in the Southern Hemisphere over the last few months, . It cut the risk of hospitalization for flu roughly in half in the first three months of the flu season there. RSV doesnt mutate nearly as much year-to-year as COVID-19 and flu do, so matching strains isnt a significant concern at this point. The shots were about 80% effective in preventing respiratory disease in trials. Insurers are required to cover flu shots every year. There initially were questions about whether the RSV monoclonal antibody for infants would be covered as vaccines are, but the CDC has said insurance companies . Unlike in previous years, the federal government isnt buying COVID-19 shots for everyone this time. Insurance will cover the updated shots, though, and a federal program is in the works to supply free doses to uninsured people through clinics and pharmacies. It gets a little more complicated with the adult RSV vaccines. Some people havent had to pay out of pocket, while the full $300 price because their insurance opted not to cover it. Its safe to get the flu and COVID shots together. There isnt as much data on combining the RSV shot with other products, so talk to your doctor if you qualify for all three and would have trouble making it to two appointments. Since it may take a while for your local clinic or pharmacy to get its stock of the new COVID-19 shots, it makes sense to go ahead and get your flu shot now instead of waiting to get them together, Duckro said. Of course, people who have specific situations, like a lack of transportation, may decide to wait, she said. Theres no reason to delay, she said.
