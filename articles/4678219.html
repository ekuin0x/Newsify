                Think you left something behind at Pittsburgh International Airport? Well you have 30 days to file a claim with the airport or risk the item being donated or going to an airport authority foundation auction on October 7. The Allegheny County Airport Authority (ACAA), which operates (PIT), is holding its 12th auction of lost and found items that overstayed their welcome of 30 days. In 2022 alone, items auctioned ranged from a Chrysler Pacifica crossover to a Nintendo Switch gaming device to shoes and boots. Jewelry items including watches were also up for auction last year. We'd love to see you on ! This year, over 150 electronic devices, including air pods, gaming consoles, and laptops will be available to bid on, for starters. There are also board games and a mini keyboard, alongside authentic luxury items like a Burberry coat and Marc Jacobs and Telfar bags. All these items were left at the airport and have gone unclaimed, which blows the mind when you see the sheer amount of lost property the airport has accumulated. Probably the most mind-boggling are the 10 abandoned cars in the parking lot, also up for auction next month. As Elise Gomez, Manager of Customer Experience, shared on the airports Blue Sky News website, The airport auction is popular each year because its a community event. There are a variety of items to bid on that tailor to different peoples interests. Any unwanted items left over after the auction, such as prescription glasses and clothing, will be donated. If you want to bid on this auction, it starts on Saturday, October 7, at the Heavy Equipment Building on Cargo Road. Licensed auctioneer Joe R. Pyle will again lead the proceedings. Doors open at 8:30 a.m. with kick-off at 10 a.m. Food trucks will be available if attendees get hungry. The ACAA uses the proceeds from the annual auction to fund Art in the Airport, aviation scholarships, and help develop future aviation and construction employees. In short, programs that may not be the best use of involuntary tax dollars. Get all the latest here The Art in the Airport program alone supports visual art at PIT, as well as its Sense of Place program and live performances of arts. The Sense of Place program funds a childrens play area, statues of Pittsburgh heroes, and tributes to the Pittsburgh art scene. Live performances include musical interludes and dance. Below are some photos of the "Art in the Airport" program: There is also a scholarship for Pittsburgh high school students interested in aviation. That means your bid at an airport lost and found auction may result in helping a student get the training needed to work at the airport. Coupled to the scholarship effort is an effort to develop future aviation and construction employees. With Pit2Work, according to the airport website, Hosted by Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT), on the site of the new Terminal Modernization Program (TMP), which is what we call the construction of our new terminal and everything that goes with it, this 5-week training opportunity immediately immerses you in discovering the trades and skills to help you take your career to new heights. One can even learn under supervision how to operate heavy construction equipment as pictured below: The program has been able to partner with the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League to help inspire youth with sayings like, The standard is the standard from Head Coach Mike Tomlin, as explained below: Tomlins point? Dont let adversity get in the way of doing the job at hand. Other airports have similar initiatives, one of which is the Unclaimed Baggage program which operates out of Scottsboro, Alabama. According to the website, the business started in 1970 when entrepreneur Doyle Owens bought unclaimed luggage from Trailways Bus Line. The business had such success that Owens quit becoming an insurance salesman and grew the company to partner with airlines. Nowadays, the store has both physical and online storefronts.
