                A major investigation is underway into an across health facilities in , with cases also reported in three other states. A Mater Hospital spokesperson confirmed cases of listeria had been reported, with a team of public health experts working to determine the source. Listeriosis is a serious illness that comes from eating food contaminated with the listeria monocytogenes bacteria.

It can also be found in raw meat, raw vegetables and unpasteurised dairy products. However, listeria can be life-threatening for people at high risk. A Mater spokesperson said the hospital is liaising with a Metro South Public Health Unit investigation into a small number of listeria cases at health facilities in South East Queensland. OzFoodNet is coordinating a national investigation into the outbreak, they said. Affected patients are receiving treatment. Queensland Health Chief Health Officer Dr John Gerrard said several potential food sources are currently under investigation. Queensland Health is currently the lead agency in one of three multi-jurisdictional foodborne disease outbreak investigations across the country due to Listeria, Gerrard said. To date, there have been nine cases reported across four states, all linked through genetic studies. Five cases were diagnosed in Queensland, and four of those people reside in Queensland. The source of infection is currently unknown, as no single common food was able to be linked to all cases. The Mater spokesperson said cases were also detected in Victoria and New South Wales, and it was not immediately clear which was the fourth state impacted. Queensland Health said listeriosis is a rare disease that often presents with few or no symptoms in healthy people. If symptoms are present, they may vary from fever, headache, vomiting and diarrhoea to more serious forms of the illness such as meningitis and septicaemia. The illness can be severe for people at high risk, including older people; pregnant women, their unborn and newborn children; people with weakened immune systems; and anyone on immunosuppressant medication. People at increased risk of listeriosis are warned to avoid high-risk foods, such as:
