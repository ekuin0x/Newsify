                The head coach named a starting lineup on Friday with no surprises as key duo Darcy Graham and Zander Fagerson returned from injury and suspension respectively for the World Cup Pool B opener against the world champions Townsend believes the sense of cohesion within the team he has picked will stand them in good stead for Sundays showdown in the latesummer heat of Marseille Its been the team that has played together in the main he said at a press conference at Stade Velodrome on Friday The majority of the players have played together all year A couple of players missed the Six Nations Rory Darge and Darcy Graham who are back fit and back with us Its a team that deserves to go out there They have earned the right to start in such an important fixture because of the way they have played and the way they have trained We have built a lot of cohesion over the last two or three months by training with certain combinations week after week Weve seen the benefits of doing that transfer into the warmup games and now its about delivering the most complete game we have done this year Scotland go into the World Cup as dark horses for the Webb Ellis Cup having emerged as best of the rest behind the heavyweight quartet of Ireland South Africa France and New Zealand Several players in Townsends team go into the global showpiece at the top of their game and the head coach is confident they can produce collectively when it matters most Its the biggest opportunity youll get a World Cup game playing the world champions he said ahead of Sundays showdown We believe weve been building to our best performance  and I know thats a continual journey and well say it again as we go towards the Tonga game  but really this is where itll count for our players to deliver what they have been delivering in training and what they have been delivering in other games weve played this year and we have every faith they will be able to do that Townsend has no worries about his players temperament as they prepare for a huge occasion in front of 67000 people in the Marseille heat Thats the job for us as coaches the senior players and the players who have been there before to be calm and to calm others he said But there is an expectation that its going to be a very emotional and exciting buildup Im sure the players will feel the sense of adrenaline nerves and excitement as we get closer to kickoff But that can be turned into a real positive It can narrow your focus but also give you that extra energy boost that you need Scotland trailed in all four of their summer warmup matches and came back to win three of them including a stirring 2521 victory at home to France while they also went close to pipping Les Bleus in the rematch in SaintEtienne before eventually succumbing to a 3027 defeat Townsend believes such experiences will give them reason for confidence if they find themselves trailing at any point on Sunday We didnt want to be 213 behind against France but this team have shown they are capable of coming back whether its in Paris in the Six Nations or at Murrayfield when a man down or SaintEtienne with the crowd and momentum against us It would be nice to be 15 points ahead but weve got to deal with whatever situation is presented at any time in the game We will be tested no doubt There will be times when South Africa have dominance South Africa have points on the board There will be times when we arent able to execute things as well as we like and thats not because its the first game of the World Cup its because of the opposition and what they bring with their pressure But weve got to find a way to win and thats what this World Cup is about finding a way to win The Scots were unable to include either scrumhalf George Horne or hooker Ewan Ashman in the 23 after the pair suffered concussion in training Stuart McInally who was cut from the squad last month has flown out to France as cover until Ashman recovers
