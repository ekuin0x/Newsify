                Tinie Tempah shared his big respect for Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jamie Carragher after being confirmed as the latest big-name act at Football for Change in November. Multi-BRIT Award winner Tempah, 34, has sold over five million records and shaped the British hip-hop industry since his breakthrough with platinum album Disc-Overy in 2010. Football for Change, launched by football stars Alexander-Arnold, Carragher and Conor Coady in 2021, alongside leading PR firm ThisGeneration Communications, aims to lift young people from disadvantaged backgrounds out of poverty with life-changing opportunities in education and employment. Other ambassadors include Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham, Arsenal and Lioness hero Beth Mead, Everton midfielder Jack Harrison and Manchester United legend turned Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville. The social mobility charity has since raised more than 700,000, with funds used to send over 100 disadvantaged children to the United States of America on sporting and educational retreats, supported the build of an education centre in Liverpool, housed homeless teenagers in Glasgow and delivered more than 100,000 of grants to organisations supporting youngsters in the most deprived areas of the country. Tempah . Football for Change chairman Carragher will also deliver a key-note speech on the night. Sir Rod Stewart headlined the inaugural Football for Change gala in 2021, followed by Oasis rock legend Noel Gallagher in 2022. Further big-name acts are set to be announced by Football for Change in the coming days. After being confirmed as the latest high-profile performer at Football for Change, Tempah said: "I can't wait to join everyone at the Football For Change gala. "It is going to be an unforgettable night and will help build better futures for kids who need it. There's an incredible lineup and some amazing people are involved. Big respect to the footballers like Trent and Jamie and everyone else who've built this incredible initiative. I'm glad I can be part of it - we're going to bring the house down!" Initiatives such as the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust, Everton in the Community, Liverpool FC Foundation and the Inclusive Hub - among numerous others - have all benefited from the major grants supplied by Football for Change to enhance the development, learning and education and housing opportunities for youngsters in need. At the 2022 Football for Change gala, headlined by Oasis legend Gallagher, stars such as Jason Manford, Coleen Rooney, Samia Longchambon and Michael Carrick turned out in force to support the event, with further big-names anticipated this year. Speaking at the launch of Football for Change, Alexander-Arnold said: "Football For Change is about giving everyone opportunities they deserve from a young age. "Cities like Liverpool are more deprived than other areas and so it's important for us to come together to support this. "Everyone that has given it their backing so far is massive for us and this is only going to help improve young people's lives by showing them a more positive path. "To have the platform I've got now and reach out to so many people, be a role model for so many, it's important to use that in the right way and get involved in initiatives like this. "You see so much deprivation within cities like Liverpool, whether that be food, shelter, education or even opportunities just to play football. "And that's why initiatives like this are so important, to give people opportunities and give people an equal chance to leave their problems to one side and prosper "Football For Change is so easy to get behind while the benefits and impact you'll have on young people will be absolutely massive." Liverpool legend and Sky Sports presenter Carragher, chairman of Football for Change, said: We are thrilled for Tinie to support Football for Change at our annual gala in November. Tinie always puts on a memorable performance and our audience will love his energy on the night! We are so excited. With Tinie and Olly Murs both confirmed, we are excited to announce more amazing acts in the coming days. Watch this space! The Football for Change fundraising gala is backed by headline sponsor Swinton Insurance, SHEIN and Legacie Developments. You can find out more about how to get involved at .
