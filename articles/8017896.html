                Impeaching a president may not have the same power it once did in Washington. But the announcement of an official inquiry today by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is the first time Capitol Hill Impeaching a president may not have the same power it once did in Washington. But the announcement of an official inquiry today by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is the first time Capitol Hill Republicans have seriously deployed impeachment in a quarter century. Much as Republicans hated Barack Obama, and much as they could have found a path to impeaching him with their large post-Tea Party Congressional majorities, they never went down this path. This is the new aggressive politics in an age of lawfare  but it's also justified by what we already know, and what we've learned in the past year. "I'm directing our House committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden," McCarthy announced. "This is the logical next step that will give our committees the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public." From the moment McCarthy became speaker, the plan of action on the potential impeachment of Joe Biden was clear. Instead of a fire and brimstone immediate action, McCarthy outsourced the work of building a case to three chairman allies  James Comer of the Oversight Committee, Jason Smith of Ways and Means and of course Jim Jordan of Judiciary. Rather than some slapdash approach as favored by the likes of Ben Domenech , Bethany Mandel , Isabel Hardman , Tony Letford , Roger Kimball , Ramesh Thakur , Augusto Zimmermann , Bella D Abrera , Philip Patrick , Flat White
