                A terrified man is chased during an attack by a crazed dog moments after it mauled a child in the street. Video footage shows the 11-year-old girl on the ground as she was being bitten. The Home Secretary Suella Braverman has called the attack appalling and has revealed she has commissioned urgent advice on banning American XL bully dogs . There is speculation the animal in the video is an XL bully. The footage shows the girl managing to escape after people intervened. She ran screaming into a shop. The dog then chased the man in a white T-shirt into a petrol station forecourt and dragged him over. Passers-by, including one who swung a large shovel at the dog, tried to protect the victim. Two men and the girl were taken to hospital. Witness Nasir Uddin said: A girl was bitten by a brown dog and [it] locked on. By the time I went up to the dog with a bar I had in the car it released the girl. It then went after a boy. My little girl and wife were screaming. He said the dog was not on a lead. An XL Bully was seen attacking an 11-year-old girl ( Image: @BullyWatchUK/Twitter) The dog attacked the young girl at a petrol station ( Image: @BullyWatchUK/Twitter) The attack was in Bordesley Green, Birmingham. West Midlands police said: A girl ran past the dog as it was being walked by its owner, when she was bitten. Two men intervened but were bitten and left with injuries to their shoulders and arms. The dog was... taken into secure kennels while [our] investigation continues. Police have spoken to the dogs owner. The Home Secretary said: The American XL bully is a clear and lethal danger to our communities, particularly children. We cant go on like this. I have commissioned urgent advice on banning them. It is said the advice was commissioned before the attack. Putting dogs on the banned list is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Danger Dogs - our demands The Mirror is calling for these changes: 1. The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act . An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered. 2. Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs. 3. A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training. The Mirror is campaigning for the Dangerous Dogs Act to be overhauled, with tougher penalties to be considered. We also demand the proper enforcement of rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs. And the Government should launch a campaign to promote responsible dog ownership.
