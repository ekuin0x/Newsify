The Fianna looked on course to secure the home win they need to ensure their safety as they led 2-6 to 0-6 at half-time thanks to goals from Peter Herron and county star Michael McKernan. Donaghmore rallied well in the second half, but a third goal from Paddy McNiece helped Coalisland regain momentum.

Coalisland, who've won 10 Tyrone Senior titles, now have to win two games to avoid the drop to the Intermediate ranks. Greencastle finished bottom after they suffered a 2-15 to 0-6 loss at Trillick and Moortowns place in the play-offs was confirmed after they lost 1-16 to 0-14 at Dungannon. The losers of Moortowns clash with Coalisland will be relegated along with Greencastle while the winners go into the promotion/relegation play-off with the Division Two play-off winners. If one of the aforementioned trio goes on to win the Tyrone SFC, they cannot be relegated and Eglish, who finished fourth from bottom after their 3-9 to 1-9 loss at Edendork, would drop into the relegation play-offs. Coalisland will take on Greencastle in their Championship opener on Saturday, September 23 at Pomeroy (3.30pm) while Moortown face Donaghmore on Friday, September 22 at Eoghan Ruadh (7.30pm). The top four places were confirmed before Sunday, but Trillick leapfrogged Carrickmore with their facile defeat of Greencastle while last seasons beaten SFC finalists lost 2-11 to 0-5 at Dromore. The top four teams, Dromore, Killyclogher, Trillick and Carrickmore will battle it out for the League title later in the year once the Tyrone SFC has been concluded. However, the play-offs will be put on hold if one of the four teams goes on to lift the ONeill Cup and progress to the Ulster Club series. Clonoe have already secured their return to the top flight after winning Division Two with Beragh and Aghyaran set to contest the promotion play-off. Fourth-placed Pomeroy would gain a play-off place if one of the three teams ahead of them win the Intermediate Championship.
