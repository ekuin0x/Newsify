                South Africas presidency is proposing spending as much as R88.5 billion ($4.6 billion) a year to tackle poverty at a time when the National Treasury is cautioning that the country has run out of money. In a presentation to business and labour leaders last week Olive Shisana, President Cyril Ramaphosas special advisor on social policy, suggested a range of measures including an unemployment grant, food support and job creation initiatives, according to a copy of the document seen and confirmed by Bloomberg. Shisanas proposals highlight the difficulties Treasury faces in getting buy in for spending cuts, days after Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said in a presentation to his political colleagues that they would be needed if the government wants to extend an existing grant to the unemployed, introduced as a temporary measure during the Covid-19 pandemic. A falling tax take as almost daily power cuts curb economic activity and a dysfunctional rail network are curbing exports has limited Treasurys options. The demands on public finances also underpin the quandary the ruling African National Congress faces months ahead of an election in which its expected to face its sternest test yet. It can either rein in social spending and invest in growing a stagnant economy or improve benefits for potential voters. It cant do both. Shisana in the "Acceleration Plan" presented to the National Economic Development and Labour Council on behalf of the Interdepartmental National Working Group on Poverty Alleviation also suggested "game-changer" initiatives, such as: Shisana, when called by Bloomberg, confirmed the presentation but declined to discuss the numbers. She said they will change constantly and that she is working on a proposal that can be included in the annual budget in February. Godongwana, in his own presentation, warned that to maintain the current unemployment grant of R350 a month would cost R40.5 billion in the next fiscal year. That, he said, could require boosting the rate of value added tax or the closure of some government programmes. Those closures, he said, would result in job losses and a freeze on government funded infrastructure projects. His presentation lays out targeted cuts of R34.9 billion but suggests achievable reductions of R16.2 billion. The Treasury didnt immediately respond to queries about Shisanas proposals and its own presentation. Shisana, in her presentation, suggests that if the measures suggested are implemented expenditure on the basic income grant will fall as more jobs are created. The presidency should adopt a guarantee that no one will live below the poverty line by 2030, she says and the plan should be evaluated every year. Godongwanas frankness about the state of national finances, reported by a number of publications, has caused tension within government. On Thursday the Cabinet said in a statement that the "budget shortfall must not impact negatively on service delivery and Godongwana will clarify misunderstandings. This dissonance between different arms of government is not unprecedented under Ramaphosas administration. While Ramaphosa has actively pushed for a green energy transition his energy minister has openly criticised measures to move away from coal. An electricity minister was appointed this year with responsibilities overlapping those of the energy and public enterprises departments.
