Softening finishes are increasingly used because they help the textiles to achieve a softness (supple, pliant, sleek, and fluffy), smoothness, more flexibility and elasticity. In addition, softening finishes also help in reducing the wear and tear of apparel, provide a refreshing fragrance, reduce the risk of germ build-up, shape retention etc. The market is mainly driven by increasing use in clothing textiles and home textiles. Among the different processes available in the textile finishing chemicals market, the pad-dry cure process is the fastest-growing segment. Almost all types of finishing chemicals are applied to the textiles using this process. This is the parent process for several different finishing treatments. It is assumed that multiple finishes may be applied to the solution bath, therefore the impacts of this stage are the same regardless the number of finishing treatments applied, thus making it the most common process of application for textile finishing chemicals.
