                Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk said Wednesday he would take Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on in a cage fight if he is up to it. After meeting with Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Capitol Hill, Musk was asked by reporters if he is still planning to cage fight Zuckerberg. If he wants to, Musk told reporters. Musk and Zuckerberg have been floating the idea of hosting a cage fight between the two of them for months. In June, Musk also said he was up for a cage match if [Zuckerberg] is. Musk said last month the exact timing of the match was in flux because of a possible minor surgery. He also teased an , which he said he confirmed with Italian officials last month. Zuckerberg later said that Musk is not serious about a cage fight, adding in August that If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. Im going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously, Zuckerberg posted on his Threads social media platform at the time. The two continued to go back and forth over whether the fight will ever happen, including Musk saying that he planned to drive to Zuckerbergs house to fight him if he answered the door. Mark is traveling right now and isnt in Palo Alto. Also, Mark takes this sport seriously and isnt going to fight someone who randomly shows up at his door, a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill at the time.
