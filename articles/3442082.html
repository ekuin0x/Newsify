                Rangers star Danilo has left McDiarmid Park for the hospital with a suspected compound fracture. The big money signing headed home after just 15 minutes but suffered a horror collision with St Johnstone's Liam Gordon in the process. Both players were replaced after checks from their respective club medical teams. Swelling around the eye was visible as the Brazilian walked off the pitch in Perth. He signalled a thumbs up to the travelling support but it appears he could have suffered a nasty injury that will come as a major blow to During the coverage of the match, commentator Ian Crocker announced: "Danilo is still making the difference but the bad news for Michael Beale is that he has left the stadium and has been taken to hospital with a suspected compound fracture." James McFadden added: "Not good, not good and it didn't look good when you seen the pictures of him walking off as well. A lot of swelling around his eye." It's the first of SEVEN games in 22 days for Rangers as they play in three different competitions between now and the next international break next month. The next four matches for the Light Blues are at home starting with Real Betis in the this coming Thursday night. They also face Livingston in the quarter-final in the coming weeks as they bid to secure a trip to Hampden and a spot in the last four of the competition as they eye up the first piece of silverware on offer this season.
