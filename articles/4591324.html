                From 2h ago 06.33 BST Cathy Freeman honoured with stand Mike Hytner Cathy Freeman , the Olympic gold medal-winner, said she felt honoured after the NSW government announced earlier today that the eastern stand at Sydneys Olympic Stadium would now be known as the Cathy Freeman stand. Freeman, who lit the cauldron at the 2000 Games opening ceremony 23 years ago before delighting a nation with her victory in the 400m final, became the first Indigenous Australian to win an Olympic track and field gold at the Games in 2000. She said: This stadium and Sydney Olympic Park hold a truly special place in my heart and that will never change. I hope that my story continues to inspire generations of girls and boys to chase their own dreams in sport and life. Australian Olympic Committee chair, Ian Chesterman , said it was a wonderful gesture. He said: Australians have a deeply shared affection for one of our greatest athletes. Her victory in the 400 metres inspired future generations and united Australians in an unprecedented fashion. A proud Kuku Yalanji and Birri Gubba woman, she has motivated both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians to reach for their dreams.

Federal MP Bridget Archer , Liberals for Yes convenor Kate Carnell and former NSW treasurer Matt Kean have all expressed disappointment in Prices comments. Price was asked on Thursday whether she believed colonisation was continuing to impact Indigenous Australians around the country. She said: Ill be honest with you, I do not think [there are ongoing negative impacts]. A positive impact? Absolutely. I mean, now we have running water, readily available food. Archer told Guardian Australia on Friday she did not share the same views as the Coalition frontbencher. I can only imagine how hurtful Senator Prices comments have been for many Indigenous communities, Archer said. Carnell, who was fresh off campaigning in the Gold Coast with Noel Pearson, said she was always disappointed where evidence isnt taken on board. The important issue is to accept [is] that might be her experience, but its not the experience of a large number of other Indigenous Australians. Kean said if we arent prepared to learn from the past, we will struggle to ever build a better future. It doesnt serve anyone any good to pretend like history didnt happen. It does actually a great disservice to try and airbrush our history, he said. 7m ago 08.14 BST Fugitive still on the run in Victoria A Victorian fugitive remains on the run, 11 days after escaping from a prison in the states west. Police said in a statement on Friday that fugitive squad detectives were appealing for public assistance to find escapee Daniel Briffa . Briffa, 50, escaped from Langi Kal Kal prison by unknown means some time between 6pm and 9pm on 4 September. He was serving a sentence for drug, theft and traffic related offences. Briffa was seen the morning after he escaped about 40km away in Alfredton, a suburb of Ballarat. He was seen on CCTV footage wearing a black jacket, loose fitting dark tracksuit pants, white runners and a white face mask while purchasing several items from a convenience store. Briffa is about 170cm tall, of solid build, short brown curly hair, a full beard and moustache. He also has tattoos on his lower legs. Detectives from the Fugitive Squad are continuing to appeal for public assistance as part of their search for escapee Daniel Briffa. If he is sighted, contact triple zero (000) immediately.

The Labor frontbencher was picked up on camera, seemingly unaware, discussing with NSW premier Chris Minns the unbelievably racist treatment she has recently had to endure. Minns asked: Have you been doing a lot of travelling? To which, Burney responded: Unbelievable. Weve just finished two weeks of gruelling parliament ... to me, its just unbelievably racist and bullying. The way they have treated me is appalling. The comments follow comments by shadow Indigenous affairs minister Jacinta Nampijinpa Price , who said she had been bombarded with abusive messages and voicemails after her phone number was leaked on social media this week.

Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian Updated at 08.07 BST 40m ago 07.41 BST Taser death information must be released urgently, NSW Greens say NSW police should urgently release further information about the death of a woman who was allegedly Tasered by officers, a state Greens MP says. Greens MP and spokesperson for justice Sue Higginson said the incident should also be subject to a full independent investigation, rather than one conducted by other police but overseen in a limited fashion by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. A 47-year-old woman died after police officers allegedly shot her with a Taser and bean bag-style rounds during a standoff at a Newcastle apartment block. She had reportedly threatened officers with an axe during the standoff. Higginson said: We have got to stop deploying deadly weapons to de-escalate and calm people in these situations. Rather than a proper independent investigation we will now see a critical incident investigation take place, where police will investigate police and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission will have some limited oversight role. Im calling on the minister for police to urgently release further information about this death in Newcastle. Trust in policing is low and the community deserves transparency and accountability. Higginson also repeated her calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the use of deadly force by police against people with complex needs.

Police are asking the public for information to help identify the remains found by a local resident on a property at Clifton Beach, southeast of Hobart, on 6 July. A lengthy forensic analysis has been conducted which confirmed the remains are human, but unfortunately an identification has not yet been made, Inspector Andrew Keane said on Friday. The remains were found near a pair of black dress shoes, a short-sleeve top, as well as a plastic bag containing two keys on a chain, a cigarette lighter and two possible ID cards. The right shoe had several store-bought orthotics in the heel. The remains were above cliffs halfway between Clifton Beach and Goats Beach.

Price on Thursday said there were no ongoing negative impacts of colonisation for Indigenous Australians , instead saying there had actually been positive outcomes. Ill be honest with you, I do not think [there are ongoing negative impacts]. A positive impact? Absolutely. I mean, now we have running water, readily available food. The comments were condemned by Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney on Friday morning, who said they were offensive and simply wrong. Assistant Indigenous Australians minister Malarndirri McCarthy also told Sky News she has had to speak with very traumatised First Nations people who are still coming through policies that did impact their lives so severely it continues to destabilise ... future generations. But Prices Nationals colleagues have come out in support of the sentiment. Joyce told Sky News Bolt Report last night he thought the speech was a masterclass and she said out loud what others thought but couldnt say. I think that Jacinta has the capacity to say things that so many other people want to say but we feel unable to say it because we will be cast as racist if we did. Its not racism, its logic. Nationals leader David Littleproud dodged directly answering whether he supported Prices comments when asked by the ABC shortly after her speech.

Vanuatus new prime minister Sato Kilman said he believed the already signed pact would need to be reworked in order to get the support of his parliament. While it has been signed, the agreement needs to be ratified by Vanuatus parliament before it can come into effect. Wong said Australia was open to further discussions after Kilman said both sides would need to revisit the agreement. She told ABC radio: Were very open to engaging with the new government in Vanuatu. If they have a different view about the way in which that agreement is structured or aspects of that agreement obviously, were very happy to discuss that. We will engage with them and take on board what it is that they want to change, if anything, in the agreement and well work through that together. Wong is in Fiji meeting with her Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) counterparts. - AAP Updated at 06.22 BST 3h ago 05.49 BST Natasha May Top medical body calls for more money to be spent on diabetes prevention, inquiry hears One of the themes which the parliamentary inquiry into diabetes keeps returning to is the need to prevent Australians from developing the chronic disease. Preventive measures are the key to lessening the impact of diabetes, the president of Australias peak medical body, the Australian Medical Association, Steve Robson , tells the inquiry: The AMA believes that preventive measures are the key to lessening the impact of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes on Australias health system and the economy more broadly. We have a sick care system rather than a holistic healthcare system that tackles both existing healthcare issues and prioritises prevention. One in 20 Australians are living with diabetes and the estimated cost of direct health expenditure is over $3bn, Robson says. If we can stop these things happening in the first place, it will set people up for a lifetime of good health which is what we want. Robson says prevention means less people will need joint replacements, develop conditions like osteoarthritis and have better mental health. There are so many advantages to prevention of ill health in the first place so we are firmly, firmly advocating for money to be spent on prevention. Updated at 06.10 BST 3h ago 05.33 BST Natasha May People with diabetes need to make 180 diabetes-related decisions a day, inquiry hears Susan Davidson , the CEO of the Australian Diabetes Educators Association (ADEA), has told the inquiry most diabetes educators are doing the work for free without any proper remuneration for the service. People with diabetes need to make 180 diabetes-related decisions a day, Davidson said, a fact which reinforces how much the people living with the chronic condition need adequate support. The organisation is calling for an upskilling of the health workforce to be able to recognise diabetes symptoms, for example unhealing wounds can be caused by diabetes. Davidson also tells the inquiry that there are often intergenerational cycles of diabetes, with children of mothers with diabetes more likely to develop it as well. There needs to be more follow up when women with gestational diabetes have their baby, with closer monitoring of their childrens blood sugar and also more education around nutrition for families, Davidson said. 3h ago 05.22 BST Queensland CCC calls for urgent legislation to release reports Andrew Messenger The Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission has called on the state government to pass retroactive legislation to allow it to release reports on two public figures. Commissioner Michael Woodford appeared at a parliamentary inquiry this morning to repeat calls for an urgent legislative fix after the body was muzzled by the high court this week. Woodford said the courts decision to quash a report into former Queensland public trustee Peter Carne hamstrung the CCC. A report into former deputy premier Jackie Trad has also been kept secret during a state court challenge. Parliamentary Crime and Corruption Committee chair Jon Krause asked if he believes the fix should be retrospective - looking back, as well as looking forward. I believe thats appropriate, Woodford said. And that would be certainly one of the positions that Id be putting forward in any discussions (with government). Woodford also pointed out that the parliamentary committee already has the Carne report and could release it, subject to legal advice, despite the High Court ruling. He said the CCC needed the power to release reports that did not lead to a finding of corruption, and stressed the need to address these issues as quickly as possible but with careful consideration to make sure that we cover everything that we need to. We believe that such reports serve the public interest, and they promote public confidence in the integrity of the public sector. Where corrupt conduct is uncovered, explaining that to the public gives confidence that investigations are conducted diligently and the corrupt conduct will be exposed. It also explains how this conduct occurred so that the public and public sector can understand how to avoid it in the future. Attorney general Yvette DAth said yesterday that she is receiving legal advice on the issue. Updated at 05.41 BST 3h ago 05.13 BST Natasha May Diabetes training for nurses offers cost effective option to improve care, inquiry hears Prof Kylie Ward , the CEO of the Australian College of Nursing, has told the diabetes inquiry there is not any training in diabetes which is free and accessible for nurses. Ward estimates it would cost between $250,000-$400,000 to deliver an online module to train nurses in diabetes management which could greatly improve care. 3h ago 04.56 BST Natasha May Diabetes Australia calls for 1800 number for diabetes Diabetes Australia is up next giving evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into diabetes. The organisation represents the 1.5 million Australians living with diabetes, which includes 1.3 million with type 2 diabetes, 140,000 with type 1 and 50,000 diagnosed with gestational diabetes in the last 12 months alone. Taryn Black , the chief strategy officer, said gestational diabetes is the fastest growing type of diabetes. CEO Justine Cain is calling for a 1800 number for diabetes to be able to triage at risk people and help link them into other services. Endocrinologist and Diabetes Australia adviser, Prof Roger Chen , says 20%-30% of people in hospital have diabetes as a comorbidity, as do 30-40% of mental health outpatients. Chen said there is often limitations on the subsidies which are available for new diabetes technology, including pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices, which drastically improve the quality of life for people with diabetes. Updated at 05.02 BST 4h ago 04.27 BST The always wonderful Weekly Beast is up. Read it here: Chris Kenny cops it from his viewers for sticking by the voice | Weekly Beast Read more 4h ago 04.21 BST Proposed Airbnb levy must go to social housing, homelessness body says The Victorian government is expected to consider a levy on short-stay accommodation such as Airbnbs at a cabinet meeting on Monday. The Council to Homeless Persons CEO, Deborah Di Natale, welcomed the reports, saying a levy as high as 7.5% could help Victoria overcome the biggest housing crisis in recent memory. She said the state trailed the nation on social housing. A levy like this would be an important step in injecting more fairness into Victorias housing system which is in dire need of major reform. That money should provide desperately needed accommodation for our most vulnerable people. A levy on bookings through platforms like Airbnb has the potential to raise more than $30m a year to house people without homes, but ending the housing crisis will require billions, not millions, in new investment.
