Joe filed for divorce from the Game of Thrones actress on September 5, saying that the union was 'irretrievably broken' and that the reason for the divorce was a difference in lifestyles. At the time, the now former couple issued a joint statement on Instagram saying: 'After four wonderful years of marriage, we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage.' They continued: 'There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.' The couple share two young daughters and nearly immediately after the Only Human crooner filed for divorce in Miami, he said his daughters have been primarily living with him on tour. Sources also claimed the reason for the split was the Do Revenge star's penchant for partying. However, in the past, Sophie has been quoted multiple times saying she's a homebody. The couple started dating in 2016 when Turner was 20 and Jonas was 27.
