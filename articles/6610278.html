                Gareth Bale plays alongside Rory McIlroy in Celebrity Pro-Am event at Wentworth, with Tom Holland, Anton Du Beke, and Dan Walker also featuring Gareth Bale was pictured playing alongside Rory McIlroy at a celebrity event He was also seen with ex-team-mate Jermaine Jenas, and Tom Holland was there Bale praised Ange Postecoglou for the attractive style he has brought to Spurs By Luke Power For Mailonline Published: 11:53, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 13:25, 13 September 2023 e-mail View comments Gareth Bale had a jolly time with Rory McIlroy in the Celebrity Pro-Am before the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. The former Spurs favourite was pictured playing alongside McIlroy in the competition and has only furthered his love for golf since retiring from professional football in January . His old team-mate Jermaine Jenas was also present at the venue in Surrey, which welcomed a range of celebrities from across different disciplines. Anton Du Beke , Dan Walker , and actor Tom Holland - who has played Spider-Man - were all present. Bale told Sky Sports : 'Obviously, I was trying to impress him [McIlroy]. The first tee is always nerve-wracking, I'm not used to hitting golf balls [in front of him] - I just hit the ball and looked forward. Gareth Bale played alongside Rory McIlroy at the Celebrity Pro-Am event at Wentworth Ex-Spurs team-mate Jermaine Jenas (far right) also featured, playing off a handicap of 3 Bale's camaraderie with McIlroy was clear to see as the two exchanged jokes and a fist bump Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man on film, also tried his luck at the star-studded event 'I just said to JJ [Jenas]: "get the ball in the air and just look for it. Hopefully it lands on the fairway."' While Jenas played off a handicap of 3, Bale played off a handicap of 0.5 alongside one of golf's greats. Meanwhile, Bale praised Ange Postecoglou for the 'great start' and 'new style' he has brought to Tottenham . He expressed admiration for the work the Australian manager has done in a short space of time and believes there is more to come. Postecoglou has won three and drawn one of his first four Premier League games at the helm, steering them into second place after joining from Celtic over the summer. Asked by Sky Sports how much he'd enjoy playing in Postecoglou's exciting system, he said: 'Yeah definitely, and it's great to see. 'They've got the style back, and that was probably something the club was looking for in how he had the team playing at Celtic. Anton De Beke (right) and Dan Walker (left, with microphone) participated in the Long Putt Challenge ahead of the Pro-Am Walker cut a cool figure, wearing a white outfit and sunglasses while gesturing to the crowd Bale praised Ange Postecoglou for bringing an attractive style and results to Tottenham 'Hopefully they get themselves up there are give themselves a chance,' said Bale Jermaine Jenas threw his hands in the air after failing to hit the longest drive in the Pro-Am 'They've had a great start and hopefully there's still more to come from the team and they keep getting better and better with the new manager and the new style. 'Hopefully they get themselves up there are give themselves a chance.' After years of generally dour football under Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Antonio Conte, Postecoglou has been a breath of fresh air at Spurs. Despite losing Harry Kane to Bayern Munich for 100m , they have looked potent going forward, scoring 11 league goals. Son is getting back to his old form, James Maddison has injected creative energy into the side, and the midfield has seen the likes of Papa Matar Sarr and Yves Bissouma step up a level. However, a defeat on penalties to Fulham in the second round of the EFL Cup is a disappointment for fans, who might have seen that competition as their best chance of silverware.
