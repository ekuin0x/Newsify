                By Steve Benen In a Labor Day speech in Philadelphia this week President Joe Biden had a little fun talking about an area where he succeeded  and Donald Trump failed We used to have the best infrastructure in the world and then we fell to 13 in the world the Democrat said  But guess what The great realestate builder  the last guy here he didnt build a damn thing Under my predecessor infrastructure week became a punchline On my watch infrastructure is being a decade This apparently didnt sit well with some of the Republicans allies Here  for example is what Fox News Brian Kilmeade told Sen Marco Rubio on the air yesterday You know why infrastructure legislation didnt pass under Trump Because of the Russia stuff that they brought up at the time Every time they roll out infrastructure some other fake Russian lead would pop up and distract everybody The Florida senator agreed Well that and a global pandemic in which local authorities across the country were prohibiting people from working So a couple of things Right off the bat we know exactly why Trumps push for an infrastructure package failed and it wasnt because of the Russia stuff or the pandemic As regular readers might recall  GOP officials spent much of the thenpresidents first two years working on repealing the Affordable Care Act an initiative that failed and a package of regressive tax breaks which passed though the party stopped talking about them because the policy was so unpopular After the 2018 midterm elections however which left the House in Democratic hands there were still hopes that an infrastructure deal could come together and Democratic leaders were prepared to make it happen Trump had other ideas According to the Republicans own version of events  the thenpresident presented Democrats with an offer The White House would work on infrastructure if Democrats agreed to stop investigating Trump scandals Democratic leaders naturally said that wasnt an option  they added of course that Congress can legislate and conduct oversight at the same time  at which point Trump abandoned the process  But just as notable was the Fox host treating the Russia scandal as if it were nonsense and Rubio going along with the line If anyone in GOP politics knows better its the senior Republican senator from Florida Circling back to our earlier coverage  after Russia launched an expansive and expensive covert military intelligence operation that targeted the US political system in 2016 the Senate Intelligence Committee launched a lengthy and thorough investigation The panel ultimately published voluminous findings  which arrived at a variety of important conclusions including the apparent fact that the Russian government directed extensive activity beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017 against US election infrastructure at the state and local level While the committee didnt find evidence of Russian attackers going so far as to change votes  congressional investigators did conclude that Moscows efforts exploited the seams between federal authorities and capabilities and protections for the states This of course was the same Senate panel that literally described a direct tie between senior Trump Campaign officials and the Russian intelligence services as part of its official findings This was not an obscure document unrelated to Rubios work on Capitol Hill he was the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when the panel released its findings If Trumps allies are looking for a credible excuse to explain away Trumps failure on infrastructure theyll have to look elsewhere This post updates our related earlier coverage  Steve Benen is a producer for The Rachel Maddow Show the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor Hes also the bestselling author of The Impostors How Republicans Quit Governing and Seized American Politics
