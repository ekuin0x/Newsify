                Sky's new documentary series exploring one of the worlds most powerful families - the Kardashian-Jenners  is to hit Sky Documentaries and streaming service NOW on Sunday, October 8. Dropping as a box-set, all three episodes will be available for viewers to binge straight away. The three-part series, produced by 72 Films, a Fremantle company, in association with Sky Studios , aims to challenge what society knows of the Kardashians, exploring their rise, reach and the cost that comes with being some of the most famous women on the planet. With exclusive, unseen archival footage and first-hand testimony from some of those within the Kardashian-Jenner inner circle, including Caitlyn Jenner, House of Kardashian challenges the audience to think about the power and influence the family wields. Caitlyn Jenner, contributor, House of Kardashian said: I was happy to participate in the interview process to share my side which points to the strength, influence, and prowess my family has in captivating the worlds attention and keeping it over the years. I am incredibly proud of all my children and stepchildren. House of Kardashian is set to premiere on Sky Documentaries and streaming service NOW on Sunday, October 8. Caitlyn Jenner in House of Kardashian Poppy Dixon, Director of Documentaries and Factual at Sky said: Whether you like, loathe or are indifferent to the Kardashians, you cannot deny the familys grip on popular culture and influence on society. The story behind how these women redefined the word dynasty, all whilst our attitude to celebrity, race and women has changed, is inspiring, thought-provoking and tells us so much about ourselves. 72 Films are experts in taking these cultural juggernauts and exploring them through ambitious and intelligent storytelling, underpinned with strong journalism and lots of juicy revelation - we are thrilled to be working with them, alongside two highly talented female directors. Clare Cameron, Executive Producer, 72 Films said: As a film-maker, you might question what is left to reveal about the Kardashian-Jenners  arguably one of the most famously, overexposed families in Hollywood. Through our interviews with those who have been in the familys orbit since the beginning, we uncover their personal motivations, and explore how a changing culture allowed their influence on women around the world to thrive.
