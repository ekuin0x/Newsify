                What is a Maverick? A Maverick is a compact pickup truck built in the Hermosillo assembly plant in Sonora, Mexico and sold in North America by the Ford Motor Company. Maverick is a 5 passenger, 4 door crew cab, compact pickup truck that lends itself to the old saying, good things come in small packages. Thats really true. The 2023 Maverick is good on capability, comfort, gas mileage and style. Maverick is the first standard hybrid pickup in America with a 2.5L hybrid gas engine and a CV(constant velocity) automatic transmission. It is Americas most fuel efficient hybrid pickup, with an EPA estimated rating of 40 mpg in city driving; the best you can get. The 2023 Ford Maverick base XL model starts at only $22,595, plus the $1,495 destination charge. The XLT edition is about $24,500 and the top of the line Lariat starts at $28,000. Adding AWD (all wheel drive) and the more powerful non-hybrid drive train is another $2,220. All Mavericks are FWD to start with and ride on a 121 wheelbase. This week Ford sent me a 2023 Maverick Lariat pickup truck to test drive and review. This Lariat FWD Edition has a base window sticker price of $27,955. The options on the test truck are: a set of Maverick logo floor liners for $135, the Lariat luxury package for $2,610, the black appearance package for $1,645, Ford Co-Pilot 360 package for $650, a sprayed in-bed liner for $495 and a Wi-Fi hotspot for $20. The MSRP manufactures suggested retail price, including the $1,495 delivery fee, is: $35,005. After adding in the state and local sales tax, plus the DMV and dealers fees, the out the door and in your driveway total purchase price came to: $39,380. For less than $40 Grand you get a very high optioned compact truck that has seating for 5, crew cab doors, a 1,500 lb payload, a 2,000 lb towing capacity, and it gets 37 MPG in everyday driving. When you opt for the most fuel efficient 2.5L I4 hybrid power train, Maverick drivers can expect an impressive fuel rating of 40 MPG in the city, 33 MPG on the highway, and 37 MPG combined. The best fuel economy for any pickup truck for sale in America. This Ford Maverick has the equipment group 500A, and that includes: a 2.91 rear axle ratio, a full size spare tire, a trailer hitch receiver, SiriusXM satellite radio, a nice set of 225/60 R18 all season black sidewall tires on 18 machined face ebony aluminum alloy wheels and a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot. For $2,610 the Lariat Luxury package can be added to the 2023 Ford Mavericks top-tier Lariat trim and it adds a lengthy list of features, like a wireless charging pad, heated seats, in-cabin and in-bed power outlets, a windshield wiper de-icer and much more. The Lariat Luxury package includes one touch up and down power front and rear windows, a second row bench seat with flip-up under the seat storage, Activex trimmed seats, ambient lighting, dual zone automatic climate control, illuminated sun visors, an IP 6.5 LCD display screen, a leather wrapped steering wheel, driver and passenger door map pockets, power windows and door locks, 12 volt power sockets, rear seat cup holders, a fold down arm rest and a 8 center stack digital touch screen. As this is a workhorse pickup truck you also get: a battery saver feature, an electronic parking brake, electronic power assisted steering, intelligent access, push button start, pre collision assist with automatic emergency braking, a rear view wide angle camera, remote keyless entry, remote start, a CV transmission with selectable drive modes, an easy-fill capless fuel filler tube, in-bed storage, LED headlamps and a power locking tailgate. The 2023 Ford Maverick is a pickup that earns its place next to the Ford Ranger and the F-150, with a novel design and surprising usefulness. When youre ready for a brand new compact pickup and you want a great running, driving and sensibly priced truck, then the 2023 Ford Maverick has to be on your ride and drive list. Its the newest and the absolutely best priced pickup truck in the entire compact pickup truck class. Maverick is the star of the Ford pickup truck lineup. Call, click or visit your local dealer for a test drive and a Bottom Line price review on a new 2023 Maverick. And remember that the base price for a Maverick starts at only $22,595. Ford  Make it With Maverick. Be smart, stay safe, and just breathe. Remember, You Are What You Drive, and maybe, just for those reasons alone, you should Drive one, Buy one, Today. Have a great day, take care, and enjoy the ride  Tony the Car Guy.
