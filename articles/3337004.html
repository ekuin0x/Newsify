                : The Zayed Sustainability Prize, the UAEs pioneering global sustainability and humanitarian award, has announced this years finalists following a deliberation by its esteemed Jury. The winners will be announced at the Zayed Sustainability Prize Awards Ceremony on 1 December during COP28 UAE, the 28 Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held from 30 November to 12 December. The Zayed Sustainability Prizes Jury elected the 33 finalists from 5,213 entries received across six categories: Health, Food, Energy, Water, Climate Action and Global High Schools  a 15% increase in submissions compared to last year. The new Climate Action category, introduced to mark the UAEs Year of Sustainability and hosting of COP28 UAE, received 3,178 nominations. From Brazil, Indonesia, Rwanda and 27 other countries, the finalists represent small and medium sized businesses, nonprofit organisations and high schools, and reflect the Prizes growing mandate to reward innovations that transcend borders and tackle pressing global challenges. H.E. Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Director General of the Zayed Sustainability Prize, and COP28 President-Designate, said the finalists exemplify the remarkable ingenuity and unwavering commitment to shaping a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet. The Zayed Sustainability Prize carries forward the enduring legacy of UAEs visionary leader, Sheikh Zayed, whose commitment to sustainability and humanitarianism continues to inspire us. This legacy remains the guiding light of our nations aspirations, propelling us forward in our mission to uplift communities around the globe.

We have incentivised solutions that are driving climate and economic progress in some of the worlds most vulnerable regions. This cycle, we received a record-breaking number of submissions from every continent. The innovations put forth by the finalists reflect a profound dedication to inclusivity and an unyielding resolve to bridge critical gaps. These solutions directly align with the four pillars of the COP28 UAE agenda: fast-tracking a just and equitable energy transition, fixing climate finance, focusing on people, lives and livelihoods and underpinning everything with full inclusivity.
