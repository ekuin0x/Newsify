                Tactless Biden says 'Good Evening, Vietnam!' while in Hanoi - as he mistakes Robin Williams' anti-war movie for a SONG - during ANOTHER bizarre press conference where he rants about 'Indians' and John Wayne President Joe Biden held a press conference in Hanoi, Vietnam Sunday night He whispered, walked about the stage and used the phrase: 'lying dog faced pony soldier,' telling a tale about 'Indians' and John Wayne The president spent two days in India for the G20 Leaders' Summit and will depart Vietnam Monday for Alaska, circumnavigating the globe By Nikki Schwab, Senior U.S. Political Reporter In New Delhi, India and Geoff Earle, Deputy U.S. Political Editor In Hanoi, Vietnam and Dominic Yeatman Published: 17:12 BST, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 20:39 BST, 10 September 2023 e-mail 390 shares 1.9k View comments A sleepy Joe Biden risked upsetting his Vietnamese hosts with quotes from the Robin Williams movie Good Morning Vietnam - which he seemed to think was a song. The 80-year-old president arrived in the country after two days at the G20 summit in India and admitted he was struggling to tell if it was day or night. Good evening, everyone, he told a press conference. It's already evening, isn't it? It's around the world in five days - it's interesting. One of my coworkers said, Remember the famous song Good Morning Vietnam? Well, good evening, Vietnam. In what was supposed to be a show of stamina - Biden is circumnavigating the globe in five days - he ended the 26-minute event by saying, 'I'm going to go to bed.' President Joe Biden held a press conference in Hanoi, Vietnam Sunday night after spending two days in India for the G20 Leaders' Summit. At the presser, he talked to reporters about a John Wayne movie that featured the 'Indians' to make a point about climate change President Joe Biden grabbed the hand mic and left the podium at one point to address a reporter who was standing to one side of the room Robin Williams was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in the 1987 movie about a disruptive DJ in the Vietnam War The president had been asked if he was concerned that there was no agreement on fossil fuels that came out of the G20 Leaders' Summit in New Delhi. He regaled reporters with a story he says is from a John Wayne movie and features the 'Indians' - not the ones he just met with - who don't buy it when a Union soldier says 'everything will be good' if they go back to the reservation. 'And the Indian looks at John Wayne and points to the Union soldier and says, 'He's a lying dog faced pony soldier.' Well, there's a lot of lying dog faced pony soldiers out there about global warming . But not anymore,' Biden said. 'All of the sudden, they're all realizing it's a problem,' the president said, whispering into the mic. He's used 'lying dog faced pony soldier,' once at a 2020 campaign event in New Hampshire and at an event in Connecticut in June , where he also muttered, 'God save the Queen, man.' Sunday's bizarre moment came at a press conference that started more than an hour late and kicked off by the president acknowledging that his aides told him who he would be calling on. 'They gave me five people here,' Biden said, returning to his custom of both calling from, and speaking about, the list apologetically. 'I'm just following my orders here,' he said at another point, as he looked at his list to call another news organization or name, as reporters in the audience yelled and waved their hands frantically to be called on. The questions were China-heavy and Biden skipped answering queries when they were piggybacked on another question - so he didn't address Russia and North Korea going into business together, nor Ukraine's discontent with the G20 statement on the war, which didn't name Russia as the aggressor. The choice of journalist also appeared to have Biden mostly ignoring a group of U.S. print and TV reporters who were girding to get into domestic concerns like his low poll numbers due to his advanced age and a possible indictment of his son, Hunter, on a gun charge. Those polls show a broad concern about his age going into a second term, with a survey last week from AP-NORC showing that 77 percent of Americans, including 69 percent of Democrats, believe Biden is too old to run for reelection . A Wall Street Journal poll out Monday had similar findings, with 73 percent of voters saying Biden is too old to run again, including two-thirds of Democrats. White House aides pointed to this whirlwind trip as evidence that Biden is up to the job. He later joked that the schedule was 'no problem.' 'I can imagine. It is evening, I'd like remind you,' a BBC reporter quipped to the president. At one point, Biden grabbed the hand mic and started walking. He moved toward the side of the stage where one of the five chosen reporters was standing, but it briefly gave the appearance he was abandoning the press conference. Every reporter on the list was a woman, something that wasn't lost on a journalist from the independent U.S.-backed Voice of America. 'Thank you Mr. President. I hope you didn't think that calling only on women would get you softballs tonight,' she told him. Biden said that wasn't the case. 'Oh I know better than that. If you sent me a softball, I wouldn't know what to do with it. I'd probably strike out even worse,' Biden joked. President Biden with general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party Nguyen Phu Trong The president admitted his whirlwind schedule had left him confused over whether it was day or night After Biden answered one of the two questions posed to him by VOA, he told the journalists, 'I tell you what, I don't know about you, but I'm going to go to bed.' But reporters in the audience kept shouting questions, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre then stepping in. 'Thank you everybody. This ends the press conference. Thanks everyone,' she said. As the president tried to answer a few more, loud jazz music started playing over him, which prompted Biden to walk offstage - and head to bed.
