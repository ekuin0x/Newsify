                LIVE Premier League Q&A: All the latest from Newcastle, with updates from Saudi Arabia's clash at St James' as Mail Sport's experts answer your questions By Sam Mcevoy and Kieran Lynch For Mailonline Published: 11:28, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 13:17, 13 September 2023 e-mail 14 View comments Advertisement Mail Sport's Mike Keegan, Craig Hope, Isaan Khan and Kieran Gill answer all the big questions regarding Manchester United , Newcastle , Arsenal and West Ham . 12:26 What's the reason for Newcastle's slow start to the season? With the group of death in the Champions League awaiting them, should there be cause for concern? CRAIG HOPE: It was always going to be a tough start given the fixture list - Villa, City, Liverpool, Brighton. A return of three points is not the end of the world. However, there are ways to lose games whereby you emerge with some credit and move onto the next one. The way Newcastle lost at Brighton was a concern. It was a performance so far removed from what we have come to expect of Eddie Howe teams. I was there and it was evident from very early on they just weren't running as hard and as effectively as they always do. Their performance was also littered with mistakes. Howe can afford to lose games given the brilliant job he has done. But no manager can afford to lose and play as poorly as they did at Brighton for too long. Saying that, I have every belief they will bounce back during a big week against Brentford, Milan and Sheffield United. I think they'll come out of this period unbeaten, at the very least. 12:16 How did Saudi Arabia's clash with South Korea at St James' Park go down with activists? Were there any protests? CRAIG HOPE: I live on Tyneside and, honestly, the game barely registered in terms of its significance. It certainly wasn't a game anyone in my social circles had any interest in attending. The crowds of around 5k reflected that, and a lot were ex-pat Saudi nationals who travelled north for the game. Yes, there was a small protest, which has circulated on social media. But the scene that played out there, one young Newcastle fan arguing with a protester, was an unsavoury one and not reflective of the wider fan base. 12:01 We're now turning our attention to Newcastle... Thanks to Mike Keegan there and thanks for your questions. Next up is Craig Hope, who will be answering on all things Newcastle and the latest from St James' Park. 12:00 And finally, how does United's new record shirt sponsor impact any potential takeover? MIKE KEEGAN: It wont make a great deal of difference. While it shows some degree of enduring strength in the business it isnt a wow deal that knocks you off your seat. The Chevrolet deal, for which they admittedly grossly overpaid, was valued at more than this and so it isnt the kind of development that you could use to try and demand a huge hike in the price those in the takeover process are willing to pay. The fact that the previous shirt sponsors were willing to walk away will also be taken into consideration. 11:56 When can we expect to see Raphael Varane return from injury? MIKE KEEGAN: Ten Hag said we should expect to see the defender in a few weeks before their clash with Arsenal. 11:35 Are they any names really catching the eye? With options on the right wing looking sparse, surely that will be the area to strengthen in January? MIKE KEEGAN: He plays on the other side but it wouldnt surprise me if Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was in the Premier League next season. I know hes had admirers here, including United, but I cant imagine he would come cheap and a switch during the season may be unlikely. As for January, a loan move may be the answer to get them through until the end of the campaign. 11:22 Is there concrete interest in Evan Ferguson? The Brighton star certainly looks like he could become the Premier League's next big star... MIKE KEEGAN: United have been watching Ferguson and monitoring his progress but the same could be said of dozens of players. They are already working two windows ahead, which is pretty commonplace across the rest of the Premier League. For each position they ideally have three or more players on a list which they scout and regularly update. 11:12 What's the situation between Jadon Sancho and Erik ten Hag after their clear-the-air talks? Does the winger still have a future at Old Trafford? MIKE KEEGAN: The fact Sancho removed that tweet would suggest that there has been movement in the right direction. The issue for Ten Hag is that the window is closed and the player is still there - so what do you do with him? Antonys absence also comes into the mix. With Greenwood in Spain United are not blessed with attacking options. The removal of the tweet could be the first step on what Id imagine will be a long path to redemption. Before everything exploded, rumours had swirled about Sanchos punctuality. Indeed I was told he was due to start against Spurs but was dropped to the bench over certain issues. United denied it at the time so I didnt write it. It cant be denied that there have been problems. As I said, its a long road but as the proverb goes - every journey starts with a single step 11:02 First question: What's the latest on the potential takeover of Manchester United? Are we any closer to a conclusion? MIKE KEEGAN: The latest is that were approaching a year since the announcement and we still dont have a conclusion. I checked in this morning with those close to the process on all sides who say it remains ongoing. One source described the Glazers as very patient people, which I guess will surprise nobody. Stubborn could be another word you might use. 10:53 Mike Keegan will be with us in just under 10 minutes Have any questions you would like to ask? Leave us a comment below. 10:51 United takeover latest Manchester United bidder Sir Jim Ratcliffe insists he 'cannot contemplate failure' if he is selected to purchase the club - as the Old Trafford takeover saga rumbles on.

Mail Online 10:47 Antony spotted back home in Brazil Pictures of Antony have surfaced on social media of the Brazilian relaxing around a pool in Brazil after agreeing to an indefinite leave of absence from his club following abuse allegations. Man United winger Antony spotted relaxing by a pool in Sao Paulo Manchester United player Antony has been pictured relaxing with friends around a pool at a gated estate near Sao Paulo after agreeing to an indefinite leave of absence. Mail Online 10:36 Jadon Sancho latest The move to delete his social media statement - which claimed he had been made a scapegoat at Manchester United - has been welcomed at Old Trafford and considered a step towards repairing relations with manager Erik ten Hag . Jadon Sancho deletes social media post claiming he was a scapegoat In a move which has been welcomed at Old Trafford and considered a step towards repairing relations with United manager Erik ten Hag, Sancho on Tuesday removed the incendiary post.
