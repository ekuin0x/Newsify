                Belgium international Romeo Lavia could be forced to wait for a while to make his Chelsea debut under Mauricio Pochettino after picking up a frustrating ankle injury Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia is expected to be out for at least six weeks after suffering an ankle injury in training. Lavia, 19, joined Chelsea from Southampton in a 58million deal last month after rejecting a move to Liverpool. The Belgium international is yet to feature for Mauricio Pochettino's side and it could be a while before he makes his debut for the Blues. The news is a blow to Pochettino, who is trying to put together a starting XI capable of qualifying for the Champions League and winning trophies. Chelsea have endured a poor start to the season, winning just one of the first four Premier League games. Lavia went over on his ankle during a training session last Thursday and went for a scan the day after. It's believed he's suffered ankle ligament damage and it'll take a while for the injury to heal, with the youngster expected to miss at least five games. As reported by the Daily Mail, Lavia will be out for at least six weeks with the injury. Chelsea are hoping to have him fit after next month's international break
