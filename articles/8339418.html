                Joe Jonas took time out of his Los Angeles concert to address his divorce from Sophie Turner . It was announced last week that the Jonas Brothers star and his Game of Thrones actress wife were headed for divorce after four years of marriage. The couple posted the same statement to their separate Instagram accounts to inform their fans. It read: "After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage. There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children." And while it was said the split was a "united decision" speculation was circulating that the pair had been arguing and living separately for months. A lot of rumours claimed Sophie had been "partying too much" while Joe watched their children. Supposedly Sophie was also caught on a Ring camera by Joe doing something that led to the divorce. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .

Addressing his divorce with the crowd at the Jonas Brothers' concert at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles, he said: "Its been a tough week. I just wanna say, look, if you dont hear it from these lips, dont believe it. Okay? Thank you everyone for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys." The speech came just before the band played their hit song Hesitate, a love song that is notably written about Sophie. Fans on Twitter posted videos and claimed that Joe was seen crying while singing the tune. While it didn't happen in the LA gig, Joe was also heard to have changed the lyrics to the song during a concert in Phoenix, Arizona. Joe told fans not to believe everything they hear ( Image: Getty Images) The original lyrics go: "Don't be scared because I'm on your side," but on Wednesday the 34-year-old changed it to: "Don't be scared because I'm on her side." Joe, 34, and Sophie, 27, first got together in 2016 after mutual friends encouraged the pair to chat. Joe ended up slipping into Sophie's DMs and the duo spent a while chatting before setting up a drinks date. Sophie previously said: "We had a lot of mutual friends, and they'd been trying to introduce us for a long time. We were following each other on Instagram and he direct-messaged me one fine day, out of the blue." They both brought pals along to their first meeting but spent the whole night getting to know each other.
