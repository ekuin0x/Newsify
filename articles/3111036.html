                Spotify's new 'Showcase' tool is poised to empower artists by providing a direct channel to promote their work within the Spotify app's revamped Home feed, TechCrunch tells us in a . Here is a closer look at its features, impact, and eligibility criteria, revealing how it promises to boost streaming success for artists and transform how they connect with their audience. Showcase: Elevating Artist Promotion Showcase, the latest addition to Spotify's arsenal of artist tools, opens up exciting possibilities for musicians to gain visibility and engage with their fans. At its core, Showcase allows artists to create mobile cards that serve as sponsored recommendations on the coveted Home Screen, one of the most-visited spots within the Spotify app. These customizable mobile cards allow artists to introduce their music, including new releases and beloved catalog tracks. What sets Showcase apart is its potential impact - Spotify reports that users who encounter a Showcase promotion are more likely to stream the highlighted release. One remarkable aspect is that Spotify intends to proactively show the campaign to those likely to stream the release, broadening its reach. Nevertheless, artists can fine-tune their campaigns to target specific listener groups, from their most ardent fans to more casual listeners. Power of Customization Spotify recognizes that effective promotion requires context, and Showcase delivers precisely that. Artists can personalize their mobile cards with compelling headlines such as "new music," "recently released," "release anniversary," and more. The Home feed, known for its billions of daily streams, is the ideal launchpad for artists seeking to capture listener interest and expand their fan base. A Suite of Artist Tools The streaming giant also previously unveiled other artist-centric tools, including " ," designed for full-screen recommendations, and " ," which empowers artists to prioritize specific songs on the platform. This suite of tools reflects Spotify's commitment to facilitating artist growth and discovery. Eligibility and Availability Now, let us address the burning question: Who can use Showcase? Initially, the tool is accessible to US-based artists whose billing reflects a minimum of 1,000 monthly streams in the last 28 days within one of the target markets. Read more . Over the next few weeks, Showcase will gradually become available to more US artists via the Spotify for Artists dashboard. The cost of campaigns, which starts at a minimum of , can fluctuate based on factors like the selected audience and market. Global Reach and Billing Requirements While Showcase is initially rolling out in the US, Spotify for Artists campaigns can target Premium and free listeners in globally. However, in at least one of these markets, artists must meet specific eligibility criteria, including minimum stream counts and follower thresholds. Additionally, billing and payment card requirements apply, with the card needing to be based in one of the designated markets. Stay posted here at Tech Times.
