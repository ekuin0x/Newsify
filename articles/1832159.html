                The UK's two largest airports, and , have become the latest facilities to report the presence of potentially dangerous concrete in terminals. The porous concrete (Raac) was discovered in Heathrow Terminal 3 last year and Gatwick has a register of Raac locations that are actively monitored. Both airports have said the affected parts of the building are currently safe and continue to be managed. The last few months have seen public buildings across the UK raise alarms due to the presence of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac), a porous material that can crumble after a few decades of use and improper maintenance. Hundreds of schools, hospitals, and homes have all used the material, with some being forced to close, with parts of London's Heathrow and Gatwick Airport joining the list as well, per the BBC. Heathrow says it first identified Raac in Terminal 3 last year and has since taken measures to ensure it remains safe. While no specific location was named, the airport noted that it can keep the material safe until "permanent solutions" can be put in place. A spokesperson for Gatwick told the BBC, LGW also noted that it has no cause for concern following the most recent inspection in June 2022 and regular checks will continue to monitor the porous concrete. Given Raac's potential to crumble after its use-by date expires and further affected by poor maintenance, repairs are extensive and expensive, with mitigation and monitoring the only other solutions. Get the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: While airports continue to check their building materials, passengers have been more than excited to fly in and out. Heathrow pulled off several near-touches with disruptive strikes, reaching settlements in most cases with unions, and saw , with August expected to be another strong month. Barring issues in recent days due to the NATS air traffic outage and , Heathrow's 2023 summer has been a lot better than last year. Heathrow has been helped by a jump in demand for transatlantic routes, with carrier staging record services this summer. While Gatwick has not released monthly passenger traffic, it reported an impressive 18.5 million passengers in the first half of 2023, a 40% increase from 13.1 million the year before. Total flights also jumped as airlines returned to full capacity and started new long-haul routes from the airport, including Norse Atlantic, Air India, British Airways, and more. While it has also faced challenges in recent days, the demand for European travel has helped it grow quickly.
