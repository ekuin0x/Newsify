                Manchester United could give a debut to Sergio Reguilon against Brighton on Saturday, but the left-back only joined the club after Burnley turned down the chance to sign him Manchester United were only able to complete a deal for Sergio Reguilon on Deadline Day because Burnley had already turned down the opportunity to sign him. Tottenham defender Reguilon joined United on a season-long loan deal, with a January break clause, as emergency cover at left-back. With Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia out injured, Erik ten Hag was desperate to find a replacement and opted for Reguilon after ruling out Chelsea 's Marc Cucurella. After being left on the bench for the 3-1 defeat by Arsenal, he could make his United debut against Brighton on Saturday. In order to land him from Spurs, United agreed to pay Reguilon's 120,000-a-week wages  something Burnley simply couldn't afford to do. "Left-backs are a bit of a rarity. Look at Manchester United  one of the biggest clubs in world football," Burnley's chief operating officer Matt Williams told BBC Lancashire. "Luke Shaw goes down injured and they take a player from Tottenham who we'd been offered three or four days earlier. It was a business decision that we didn't sign him  salaries, loan fees etc." United were not initially looking to sign a left-back in the summer transfer window, ( Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)
