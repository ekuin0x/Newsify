                As I wrote a while ago, one free and easy way to massively upgrade your home movie viewing is to . Unfortunately, though, you may well find that the very kit youre watching your movies through is creating light pollution itself. This came to a head for me recently when I swapped the and that I was using at home for a Panasonic LZ1500 and speaker system. Broadly speaking, thats a big upgrade, but I quickly noticed all of the new kit was shining bright lights right at me when I was trying to immerse myself in some pitch-black movie action. You see, the C2 was set so that its standby light only came on when the set was, well, on standby, and the Sonos Arcs light only comes on when youre actively interacting with the soundbar (and even then it automatically adjusts to ambient lighting conditions). This is very much not the case with the Panasonic TV, which has a bright green light on at all times, or the Sony HT-A9, which has a bright display on the main unit and a very bright green light on each of the four speakers. This isnt unusual, either. In fact, the LG TV and Sonos soundbar are unusual in having thoughtfully implemented lighting  most kit chucks out at least a bit of light. To some people, this just wont be a big deal, but I find it really distracting, particularly when using an . I want the only light in the room to be coming from the screen, and with OLED it can come from only the specific pixels that are supposed to be lit at any given moment. The action emerges from the darkness in a way thats like the cinema  better, in some ways, as even proper cinema rarely do proper black and cinemas always leave some lighting on for something called "safety". Thankfully, this living room light pollution, as I like to call it (yes, I am fun at parties, why do you ask?), is usually fairly easy to defeat, though it can involve delving into the deepest recesses of your devices menu systems. Im obviously not going to give specific instructions for every , sound system and source device in existence, but I can give a couple of examples and some broad guidance. The first thing to do is check whether your devices remote has a dedicated button for this. As it happens, the Sony HT-A9 Im using does, though its labelled Dimmer, which I dont think makes its use terribly obvious. However, pressing it once reduces the brightness of the front panel and the light on each of the speakers, and pressing it again turns all of them off  although they do light briefly when you turn the system on and the display reacts when you press a button. In the case of the Panasonic TV, you have to go all the way down to the bottom of the Setup menu, into the final Other Settings sub-menu, and change the Power LED Indicator option, which you can turn off entirely or set  as I have  to On (Standby Only), which means the LED will be lit when the set is off (it can sometimes be hard to tell whether an OLED TV is on or off without some sort of indicator). Somewhat annoyingly, the white light on the front of an  which is tiny but piercingly bright  cant be turned off, but at least the unit itself can be fairly easily hidden away (though do make sure its got some air flowing to it). The , on the other hand, is too big and runs too hot to be easily hidden, and its rather bright lighting cant be switched off either. That can be a real irritation for people who game at a desk with the console right next to their display, and its especially disappointing when you realise that the s much less distracting power light can be dimmed or switched off  you can find that option in the Night Mode menu within the TV and Display Options. Overall, most serious home cinema equipment will include options for dimming and turning off the lights and displays  you just have to spend some time hunting them down, which I admit can be a bit tricky with something as complex as an . For me, its well worth the effort, but as should already be abundantly clear, I am a right nerd about this sort of thing.
