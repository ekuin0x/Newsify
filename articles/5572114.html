                American investment firm 777 Partners have hinted at why they are interested in Everton amid reports of advanced talks over acquiring the club from Farhad Moshiri. First reported by Bloomberg on Monday evening, the Miami-based firm has been linked with the Blues since the beginning of the year, holding talks with Moshiri and and his representatives before the owner eventually went with MSP Sports Capital. The deal with MSP was worth 150m to the club, with 100m of that funding for the stadium build while the remaining funds were for a 25% equity stake in the club. However, owing to objections raised by an existing club lender over the proposed terms, the deal for equity with MSP collapsed, although the loan for funding remains intact. That kicked open the door for , who operate a multi-club portfolio that includes Genoa, Vasco da Gama, Standard Liege, Hertha Berlin, Red Star FC and Melbourne Victory, with the group understood to be edging closer to an agreement with Moshiri over a full buyout. But why Everton? The investments made by 777 so far have been in largely distressed assets, with the football clubs acquired struggling either competitively or financially, in some cases both. 777 and co-founder Josh Wander have declined to comment on specific interest in Everton, although Wanders comments to Genoa fans via a presentation that sought to raise 5m through a bond scheme for development of a new training facility in the city did give some clues as to why they may have set their sights on Everton. Wander said: The club itself (Genoa), one of the oldest in the world, was something that we were looking for when we invested in Italy. We love to invest in clubs that have really rich traditions and great histories, and so understanding that Genoa was the oldest and most historic in all of Italy was important to us. Genoa has the best fanbase in all of Italy, sitting in the best football stadium in all of Italy. Those three things, the city, the history of the club and the fanbase, were all that we needed to buy Genoa. As part of the presentation for the Genoa Bond, which is seeking to raise 5m in funds through a five-year bond at a nine per cent annual yield to redevelop a historic abbey in the city into a training base for the club, Andres Blazquez, CEO of Genoa, spoke of the desire of the ownership group to turn the Serie A side into a sustainable club. Blazquez said: As CEO of Genoa as part of we want to restore Genoa to its rightful position in European football and Italian football. One of our main goals is to render Genoa a sustainable club. The main factor would be to have a successful youth centre and to develop a new sports centre. While 777, whose co-founder , appears to be edging close to some kind of agreement with Moshiri, there is a considerable amount of road left to travel. Due diligence will need to be conducted from both sides, then there will have to be proof of funds provided to the Premier League, with the potential ownership group, whose multi-club model isnt without controversy given the struggles of its clubs so far, having to satisfy the appropriate Owners and Directors Test in order to complete a takeover of the club. The ECHO understands that Moshiris representatives were pitching for a majority stake in the club as recently as three weeks ago, as well as pitching to boutique banks around financing options. One of the main issues that is understood to have tempered interest from some potential investors is not the valuation of the club, believed to be 350m to 400m, it is the additional funding that would be required to complete the build of the 52,888-seater stadium development at Bramley-Moore Dock. Earlier this year 777 Partners had engaged London-based Tifosy Capital & Advisory to help them raise $220m (176m) to grow their portfolio through the purchase of additional clubs.
