                Chris Evans' old home in Windsor hits the market for 4M<br><br><br> just don't mention the neighbours EXCLUSIVE: Three-storey, six-bedroom Grade II listed Georgian masterpiece goes on sale for 4million House boasts direct access to Windsor Great Park - and sits half a mile from Prince Andrew's Royal Lodge By Jon Brady Updated: 10:47, 10 September 2023 e-mail View comments Advertisement A six-bedroom three-storey house on the very edge of Windsor Great Park once lived in by Chris Evans - with direct views of Prince Andrew's home - has gone on the market for 4million<br> The Gate House, located two miles south of Windsor, is a Grade II-listed detached Georgian red brick house that sits at the very end of the road that leads into the sprawling 4,800 acre (1,942 hectares) green space, which for centuries was a royal hunting ground<br> Among the neighbours any prospective buyer would have is the disgraced Duke of York, whose official home, the Royal Lodge, is half a mile down the road inside the park itself and can be reportedly seen from the house; while Windsor Castle is just a few miles away<br> Agents Inigo say the 3,500 sq ft home boasts 'wonderfully preserved and restored' original features inside, complemented by sympathetic modern additions including a designer kitchen and luxury bathrooms<br> A two-storey addition was added to the side of the house, boasting a second, larger reception room and an additional bedroom, built with the same red bricks in a Flemish bond as the house itself<br> The Gate House is a luxurious Grade II-listed detached Georgian red brick house on the edge of Windsor Park A library and study with custom bookshelves and an open hearth awaits in the first room to the right of the entrance hall A wider view of the kitchen<br> The five door Aga stove sums up the versatility of the room, which combines modern conveniences with period character<br> The dining room can be seen through the French windows at the rear Entering the grounds through a set of electronic painted wooden gates and up a pea-gravel driveway, visitors are greeted by a huge six-panel door and radial fanlight, which leads into a pitch pine floorboard entrance hall<br> To the right sits an elegant library and study, walls lined with custom-built bookshelves and an open hearth - while the dining room, drawing room and access to the terrace sit on the other side of the hall<br> READ MORE: Prince Andrew is seen riding horses and driving his Range Rover at Windsor Castle 'after King Charles ordered Royal Family to welcome him back into the fold' <!- - ad: https://mads<br>dailymail<br>co<br>uk/v8/gb/home/property/article/other/mpu_factbox<br>html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement The drawing room boasts another fireplace - a 19th century example built in France based on 18th century designs - and a pair of French windows lead out onto the western-facing terrace<br> The York stone terrace overlooks an immaculate lawn bound by deep flower beds - and a private entrance gate to the park, complimented by a wisteria-wreathed iron serpentine pergola<br> As part of the Crown License conditions attached to the land, the King commands the tenant to 'tend and cherish' the wisteria that adorns the trellis - and it is said that Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, would often stop by to check on the health of the plant when she lived at the Royal Lodge<br> Behind the dining room is the kitchen - paved with limestone flags, and finished with black granite worktops and Plain English Design cabinetry<br> Despite being a modern kitchen - with integrated dishwasher, five-door Aga stove and a dresser that hides a modern fridge-freezer - it is full of traditional touches that ground it in its surroundings, from a central island unit on country house-style legs, an antique wooden bacon rack and a slate sink<br> Behind the kitchen, there is a traditional scullery, with another complimentary slate sink, a larder with slate shelves, a boot room and flower cupboard, as well as a washroom and the boiler room<br> Heading upstairs, the first floor features two bedrooms, a shower room and the principal bedroom suite, to which the entire western wing extension is dedicated - made up of the chambers themselves, a dressing room and a dedicated bathroom<br> The dressing room is adorned with panelled fitted wardrobes, while the bathroom has a claw-foot tub at its centre and a traditional shower attachment<br> As with the kitchen, careful attention has been paid to ensure the modern bathroom fits in with its surroundings - with a vanity unit on country house-style legs and a wall-height shoe cabinet with enough room for even the most demanding of footwear collections<br> Two-west facing and one south-facing window allow gentle light to enter in the morning<br> Two other bedrooms sit on the east wing, with one boasting wardrobes along its length<br> The master bedroom takes up the entire west wing of the first floor of the Gate House The adjacent bathroom - reserved for the master (or mistress) of the house - features twin sinks and a vanity table set on traditionally styled table legs and a claw-foot bathtub at its centre The second floor is home to three further bedrooms and an additional bathroom - with one bedroom configured as a second study and library with bespoke bookshelves and cupboards<br> North and eastern windows make it a 'lovely space to work in the mornings', according to the agents<br> The central landing leads to another bedroom to the west, while access to a partially-boarded loft space can be found overhead<br> The western bedroom can be bisected thanks to wide-set wedding doors, allowing it to be reconfigured as either a dressing room or a smaller room for an infant<br> Other hugely desirable features of the luxury lodgings include a northern terrace, from which deer can be seen as they make their way across Windsor Great Park, and a detached garage with a 1,800-bottle capacity wine cellar underneath<br> Agents Inigo said of the home: 'Set on the edge of Windsor Great Park, this exquisite Grade II-listed detached Georgian red brick house is the very last house on the much-coveted road<br> 'Internal accommodation extends to almost 3,500 sq ft across six bedrooms, while the wonderfully preserved and restored original interior features are complemented by sympathetic additions, including a Plain English Design kitchen and Aston Matthews bathrooms<br> 'Large mature gardens envelop the house, directly abutting Windsor Great Park, at the edge of the deer park - Royal Lodge is this homes immediate neighbour<br> 'Access to central London is excellent, with trains from nearby Egham station taking 40 minutes, and Heathrow Airport is just 20 minutes' drive away<br> 'Local day and boarding school options are exceptional, and opportunities for country pursuits, including polo, golf, horse riding and horse racing, are world-class<br>' Radio and TV presenter Chris Evans rented the home for around two years, paying a reported 6,000 a month<br> He is seen here in November 2019 driving out of Windsor Great Park in an Aston Martin Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park is home to Prince Andrew - the new immediate neighbour of whoever snaps up the 4 million Gate House Prince Andrew seen in Windsor Park earlier this week<br> He is said to have signed a 75-year lease on the Royal Lodge in 2003 Radio and TV show host Chris Evans rented the house for around two years for 6,000 a month - and was once reprimanded by security at Andrew's estate for attempting to drive through Great Windsor Park in a 1964 Aston Martin DB5<br> Evans was snapped trying to take the shortcut via the entrance close to the house in late 2019 - which would have cut miles, and minutes, out of his journey between the house and a property he was renovating in Ascot - days after Prince Andrew stood down from Royal duties<br> The Duke of York disappeared from public life following a disastrous Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, in which he sought to clear the air after Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile financier he had regarded as a friend, was found dead in a New York jail cell<br> Andrew has been accused of sexual abuse - charges he has strenuously denied<br> He paid a multi-million pound settlement to one of his accusers, Virginia Giuffre, in February last year<br> Despite relinquishing Royal duties during the reign of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Andrew has continued to live in the Royal Lodge<br> He took up residence in the park in 2003, signing a reported 75-year lease on the building , and has reportedly suggested he will not leave -
