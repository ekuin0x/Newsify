                RICHARD LITTLEJOHN No heat pump Put your thermals on youre nicked By Richard Littlejohn for the Daily Mail Updated 0951 BST 8 September 2023 email 265 shares 15k View comments Outraged at having to pay 1250 a day for driving your noncompliant car in Genghis Khans Ulez zone or one of the other cynical low emissions rackets popping up everywhere You aint seen nothing yet The ecomaniacs are coming for your house next as part of their deranged mission to make us all colder and poorer Under new legislation which sailed through its third reading in the Commons this week homeowners and landlords whose properties dont meet Net Zero targets could be fined 15000 and jailed for up to a year Yep you could end up behind bars if you fail to fit a heat pump While most reporting of the Energy Bill has centred on the Government s shameful Uturn on allowing onshore wind farms  there has been scant coverage of the clauses which criminalise failure to comply with energy efficiency regulations If the Bill passes into law it will provide for the imposition of civil penalties not exceeding 15000 and criminal offences not exceeding 12 months imprisonment Under new legislation which sailed through its third reading in the Commons this week homeowners and landlords whose properties dont meet Net Zero targets could be fined 15000 and jailed for up to a year Yep you could end up behind bars if you fail to fit a heat pump While most reporting of the Energy Bill has centred on the Government s shameful Uturn on allowing onshore wind farms  there has been scant coverage of the clauses which criminalise failure to comply with energy efficiency regulations Anyone selling or letting a property must obtain an energy performance certificate Inspectors will be given the power to order improvements and prevent the property being sold or let if they are not carried out to the letter Such improvements will include fitting heat pumps loft insulation double glazing and socalled smart appliances Compulsory installation of smart meters fridges washing machines immersion heaters and so on all connected to the internet will allow the Government and the energy companies to monitor electricity consumption and switch off your supply if they think youre using too much Im not making this stuff up Its all there in Hansard Parliaments official record When the Energy Bills third reading came before the House this week only a handful of MPs spoke out against it Honourable mentions must go to Tory members including Jacob ReesMogg  John Redwood Craig Mackinlay and Richard Drax Drax B as hes known in the trade The rest of the Muppets sat on their hands or retired to the subsidised bars and restaurants as this sinister piece of legislation slithered its way through the session virtually unopposed Some of the more bonkers MPs even thought these draconian proposals didnt go far enough Brightons Green MP Caroline Here We Go Looby Lucas called for an immediate end to all gas and oil exploration on the bizarre grounds that this would free us from dependence on Vlad Putin Eh Outraged at having to pay 1250 a day for driving your noncompliant car in Genghis Khans Ulez zone or one of the other cynical low emissions rackets popping up everywhere You aint seen nothing yet  Pictured London mayor Sadiq Khan Ed Miliband moved an amendment which would have forced the National Grid to get rid of all fossil fuels by 2030 Nurse Fortunately Mister Eds economic suicide prescription fell at the first hurdle But Tuesdays risible debate only served to demonstrate just how comprehensively and apparently irreversibly our elected representatives have capitulated to the Net Zero nutcases When push came to shove only 19 MPs voted against the Bill So out of a grand total of 650 we must assume that 631 either couldnt be bothered or genuinely believe turning homeowners into criminals in their insane crusade to cut the worlds carbon output by a piffling 1 per cent is a proper way to behave in a modern alleged democracy Do they really think people should be banged up for failing to fit a heat pump And is this the desperate state to which a socalled Conservative Party  which is supposed to stand for individual liberty and a propertyowning democracy  has been reduced Answers on TikTok to No 10 since social media is about the only thing politicians seem to give a toss about these days Spineless Sunak performs an immediate reverse ferret every time he comes under pressure from his backbenches His latest climbdown was over onshore windfarms which he promised to ban during his leadership campaign Following a revolt by a bunch of virtuesignalling MPs with an eye on their future career prospects after the Tories inevitable defenestration next year the PM buckled AntiULEZ protest outside Down Street on the day the controversial charges were introduced Pictured ULEZ cameras stolen from traffic lights in Eastcote Pinner in the London Borough of Hillingdon They were led by Alok Sharma the former windmills minister who actually burst into tears back in 2021 when delegates at the COP26 jamboree watered down his proposals to take the world back to the Stone Age Maybe when Nurse Ratched has finished with Mister Ed she might give Alok the onceover I wonder if Sharma bothered to read the comments of Indian Prime Minister Modi yesterday as he hosted the G20 summit in Delhi Modi made it clear in no uncertain terms that unless the West bribed emerging economies like his own to decarbonise there was no question of India shutting down let alone refraining from opening new coalfired power stations Call it 100 billion for cash All this at a time Sunak is trying to stitch up a trade deal with India So hes happy to do business with a major international polluter but at the same time thinks its a good idea to send his own citizens to jail for failing to fit a heat pump which wont make the slightest difference to global emissions And you thought Genghis Khans Ulez was as bad as it gets You aint seen nothing yet Put your thermals on chummy youre nicked An Iranian national trying to cross the Atlantic to Britain on a giant hamster wheel has been arrested 70 miles off the coast of Georgia  He apparently set off from Florida  where he had been living My guess is that he was worried Florida governor Ron DeSantis would put him on a bus to a Democratrun sanctuary city such as New York So he decided to try his luck in Britain instead confident in the knowledge that wed roll out the red carpet and hed be billeted in a fourstar hotel with zero prospect of ever being deported An Iranian national trying to cross the Atlantic to Britain on a giant hamster wheel has been arrested 70 miles off the coast of Georgia He apparently set off

previous attempt in 2014 was detained 70 miles into his journey which he was trying to make in a human powered hamster wheel Baluchis vessel pictured here in 2021 a giant hamster wheel was declared unsafe He was using it to cross the Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Britain Several years ago this column imagined migrants coming across the Channel on everything from lilos and jet skis to inflatable swans illustrated by another of Garys brilliant cartoons Now that the Government is spending 2million a year rounding up abandoned dinghies along the Kent coast and attempting to stop China and Turkey supplying the people smugglers with replacements how long before migrants start looking for alternative vessels Everybody back on the hamster wheel Lifes a beach and then you fry The British are the most workshy in Europe according to a new survey Tell us something we dont know On Wednesday only 20 per cent of Whitehall civil servants turned up at the office As the mercury soared into the high 80s in old money the pub gardens and parks were packed with people working from home On beaches around the country sunbathers were cheek by jowl not a laptop in sight The heatwave coincided with the news that 55 million people are now claiming out of work benefits half of them on disability payments I was in Central London and the whole city was alfresco in shorts and flipflops They cant all have been suffering from mental health issues  although judging by their dress sense quite a few of them might be BRIGHTON Sunseekers rushed to the beach on Thursday retreating from packed sweaty cities amid the searing 32C heat that scorched the country The fact is the Covid furlough which went on far too long and the cult of WFH institutionalised idleness especially in the public sector People got used to money for nothing and their chips for free Doing stuffall is now looked on as an entitlement And the politicians are too timid to pull the plug on unjustified state handouts It might just be me but theres a Last Days of Rome vibe abroad right now Its not going to end well A bendy bus used to ferry passengers from Luton Airport to the railway station has turned up in Ukraine where it is transporting troops from the front line for rest and recuperation This isnt the first time an airport bus has found its way across the Channel Years ago when I played football for the Surrey Herald we had an annual European tour One year we were headed for Vannes in Brittany GoAhead confirmed its fleet of purple bendy buses had been donated to SHAP on August 21 Our assistant manager Willie said hed organise a coach As we waited outside the pub in WaltononThames up trundled an airport shuttle bus Wed forgotten Willie worked at Heathrow  Most of us spent the journey standing up straphanging as we crawled through France at a speedrestricted 30mph Lets hope the brave Ukrainians have a more comfortable experience As the lovely Lorraine Chase might have replied in those old Campari ads Were you
