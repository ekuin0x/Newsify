                Uniteds stadium proposals were analysed in detail by councillors ahead of a crucial meeting next week. The Us are looking to build a new ground at The Triangle, south of Kidlington Roundabout, with the clubs licence agreement at the Kassam Stadium running out in 2026. It was revealed yesterday that Oxfordshire Council officers have recommended selling land to the club, for the purpose of a new stadium. Prior to the councils cabinet making a decision next Tuesday on whether or not to approve the sale of the land to United, the local authoritys place overview and scrutiny committee mulled over the plans and officer recommendations. One of the hot topics was what may happen if the Us suffered financial problems in the future, and how that may have an impact. Paul Grant, head of legal at the county council, told the meeting: If the club went into administration in the future, the likely cause of action is an administrator would take over and would administrate the affairs of the club. Its not out of the question that the club would cease to exist, but I would question how many football clubs have actually ceased trading in the last 50 to 100 years. What tends to happen is the assets go to a phoenix club. I think its worth bearing that in mind as part of the equation. The councils chief executive, Martin Reeves, added: The process youre quite rightly deeply scrutinising is related to a very specific unique set of circumstances. A lot of the process weve talked about are based on information officers are aware of at this . Earlier in the meeting, a presentation by council officers demonstrated why a freehold transfer would be preferable compared to a leasehold. The presentation stated: Officers believe that a freehold transfer is the best option based on offering best value, limiting financial risk, and removing ongoing management responsibilities for the council. There are significant costs and complexities associated with a leased arrangement, together with potential liability. It was fascinating to get insight from former coach , who is set to take on the likes of Neymar, Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic in the Asian Champions League this season Committee member councillor Andrew Coles said at the meeting: Having followed this all the way through, Im satisfied weve done very thorough pieces of work to engage. The priorities the council posed were quite challenging and its very clear to me theyve been met. Yesterdays report revealed that officers have advised the local authoritys cabinet to approve using council-owned land for a new stadium. The officer recommendation comes with a condition that United must produce a net zero plan which comes with clear timescales and outcomes from design, construction and full operation of the stadium. The advice to approve also includes the agreement that the use of the land is for football/ community sports and leisure/ sports stadia in perpetuity, with limited ancillary commercial use. Should the cabinet approve the sale of the land next week, the club still requires planning approval from Cherwell District Council as the local planning authority.
