                Apple is expected to debut its iPhone 15 lineup Tuesday at the companys annual September keynote event, and it could introduce the biggest in 11 years. The press event, which Apple teased with a wonder lust tagline, will take place at the companys headquarters and will be livestreamed on its website, starting at 10am local time. Although the annual iPhone event has become formulaic over the years, announcing incremental changes to battery life, camera system and displays, this year Apple is expected to introduce USB-C charging to its smartphones for the first time. Watch the latest News on Channel 7 or stream for free on The change could ultimately streamline the charging process across various devices and brands. But the company will have to show off more than just a new charging system to get users to upgrade. Last month, Apples sales fell for the third consecutive quarter. iPhone revenue came in at $US39.7 ($A62) billion for the quarter, marking an approximately 2 per cent year-over-year decline. Heres more of what to expect: Apple has previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, but now may be the time for the company to finally make the change on iPhones. The move would come less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers. This is arguably the biggest disruption to iPhone design for several years, but in reality, it is hardly a dramatic move, CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood said. Last year, Apples senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, publicly stressed the value and ubiquity of the Lightning charger, which is designed for faster device charging, but noted obviously we will have to comply with the EU mandate. The Lightning charger was introduced in 2012. The change to USB-C would also likely usher in a wave of charging accessories, potentially in various colours. Its possible iPhone users will also pay up for a USB-C wall adaptor because it will be a different size connector. The entire iPhone 15 lineup is rumoured to get the Dynamic Island feature  an interactive home for alerts, notifications and various controls  that replaces the notch on top of the screen. The tool launched on the higher-end iPhone 14 Pro models last year. Although there are few other rumours circulating about its entry-level iPhone models, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max models are expected to get a handful of new features, according to a . This may include a rear-facing periscope lens, which allows for more optical zoom, and a titanium casing to make the device up to 15 per cent lighter and thinner. The Pro models are also expected to get Apples latest A17 chip  the first with 3 nanometre technology, which could deliver faster processing and a longer-lasting battery. The lineup is also expected to come in various new colours, as hinted at in the Apple logo featured in the events invitation, including navy and updated shades of grey, white and silver. In June, Apple introduced the , a mixed reality headset that the company says will usher in a new era of spatial computing. Insider Intelligence analyst Yoram Wurmser believes the company will tease some new features and deeper collaborations to drum up excitement ahead of its 2024 launch. The headset blends both virtual reality and augmented reality, a technology that overlays virtual images on live video of the real world. The headset is Apples biggest, and riskiest, product launch in years. The company typically unveils its latest Apple Watches alongside the iPhone each year, so its likely well see the debut of the Apple Watch Series 9 and possibly, its next-generation Ultra 2 smartwatch, its more rugged wearable for serious sports enthusiasts. According to Bloomberg, Apple is working on a full revamp of its smartwatch for next years Apple Watch Series 10, so this years updates will be relatively minor. In addition, Apple is expected to show off its next-generation AirPods with a new charging case that will work with USB-C cables. Its also likely to announce launch dates for its next-generation operating systems for the iPhone, iPads, Mac computers and Apple Watch. In May, for example, Apple showed off a slew of new tools coming to iOS 17, such as a more accurate autocorrect, a new feature called Live Voicemail that will transcribe a callers message in real time, and a NameDrop tool that lets users share their contact information by holding two iPhones close together. The iPhones phone app will also reposition the hang up button to the bottom right of the screen, next to other functions. With the new iPhone expected to take centre stage, many analysts dont anticipate Apple will release new iPads or Mac computers until October. Despite rivals Samsung and Google doubling down on foldable devices, Apple is still not expected to unveil a similar version this (northern hemisphere) autumn.
