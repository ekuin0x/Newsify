photo Experts recently told The Korea Times that a SeoulWashingtonTokyo security deal signed at Camp David last month would not expose South Korea to a greater Taiwan war risk AFPYonhap Trilateral security pact does not make Seouls involvement more likely experts say By Jung Minho After a new SeoulWashingtonTokyo security pact was sealed last month to reinforce cooperation in the IndoPacific region critics in South Korea claimed that the deal could expose their country to a greater risk of being drawn into a potential war over Taiwan  a volatile superpower flashpoint At a recent meeting with officials of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea Kim Dogyun former commander of the Capital Defense Command said with their stated commitment to unity South Korea is now more likely to be embroiled in issues of potential armed conflict It is very likely that the move packaged as the trilateral security partnership against North Korean threats aims largely at strengthening containment against China he said Such views are shared by more than just a handful of politicians A poll released Wednesday shows that 448 percent of respondents said they believe the threeway deal would not be helpful for the security of their country That however is a weak argument according to security and foreign relations experts They said with the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States already in place South Korea would have to respond militarily regardless of the trilateral pact should US forces clash with those of China over Taiwan a selfruled island Beijing claims as its territory Considering other risk factors before and after the possible outbreak of violence in that area South Korea is safer not less so with the pact they added Please consider that the USROK Mutual Defense Treaty is a mutual defense treaty My reading of that treaty says that even if the ROK South Korea decides not to send forces to assist Taiwan in a conflict as soon as China attacks any US military base in the Pacific the ROK would have a responsibility to support the US said Bruce Bennett a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation a US think tank The treaty states that in such cases either party would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes Now some in the ROK may perceive that this is a weak requirement that the ROK might evade but think how the American people would react if China attacks the US Kadena Air Base in Japan and the ROK fails to support the United States after decades of US support Bennett said It is of course the ROK choice whether or not to send forces to defend Taiwan but a ROK failure to defend US forces and civilians after a Chinese attack on US facilities or the United States would to me imply a ROK abrogation of the Mutual Defense Treaty and the Trilateral Summit has no effect on this bilateral ROK responsibility The addition of Japan to the already existing South KoreaUS security system would not hurt the core of that partnership according to Sean King senior vice president at Park Strategies a New Yorkbased advisory firm Nothing discussed or signed at Camp David makes any potential South Korean wartime involvement more or less likely he said President Joe Biden again reaffirmed Americas extended deterrence commitment to South Korea at Camp David which is only good for the USROK alliance longterm Asked about the prospect of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan experts said they think it is highly unlikely given the stability brought about and supported by international security principles in the region including the South KoreaUSJapan pact I think it is unlikely now I think mutual deterrence is stable said Daniel Pinkston an East Asia expert at Troy University in South Korea I think the trilateral statement is aimed at deterring Beijing from using force to resolve the Taiwan issue So this turns on what people believe about the credibility of that deterrent signal I tend to view it as credible so I think the risk of conflict is lower than if the US were to abandon its security commitments in the region and if trilateral security cooperation were absent President Yoon Suk Yeol left walks alongside US President Joe Biden center and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ahead of their trilateral summit at Camp David near Thurmont Md Aug 18 local time Yonhap Japans help is critical against North Korea For South Korea one of the most important gains from the Camp David deal was a renewed stronger partnership with Japan which Bennett thinks will be essential if Pyongyang decides to invade South Korea  a possibility that is in his view at least as likely as a Chinese attack on Taiwan I think it is being misunderstood because the ROK people dont understand that the United States cannot rapidly send a major military force to defend the ROK without substantial Japanese assistance he said And now that the ROK has reduced its Army from 560000 active duty personnel to 360000 over the last 20 years and that number continues to fall a rapid US deployment is absolutely required There are many forms of military coordination where Japanese help could be critical against North Korea In a hypothetical conflict the North is expected to send many submarines and other naval combatants out into the East Sea Even a few of those leaking south could force the closure or limited use of key ports in the ROK until the threat is eliminated think of the insurance liability of the shipping companies alone Japanese naval help will significantly reduce the damage that North Korea could do Bennett said Japans antimissile system could also help by reducing the number of North Korean ballistic missiles cruise missiles and drones that could effectively strike South Korea Given that the North would arm at least some of these delivery means with nuclear weapons the damage to the ROK could be significantly reduced with Japanese coordination Bennett said It is true that the trilateral pact demands South Korea assume greater responsibilities in the regional security experts said But it is ultimately in its national interest as it depends on the stability and peace in where it belongs they added It is designed to make our collective defenses stronger Bennett said No surprise that both China and North Korea strongly objected to the Trilateral Summit They both want to be able to coerce the US ROK and Japan and the Trilateral Summit undermines their ability to do so
