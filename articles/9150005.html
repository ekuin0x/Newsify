                A team of students from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany has achieved a remarkable milestone in (EV) field. They have set a new world record for the longest-range electric car, covering an astounding 2,573 kilometers on a single battery charge. This achievement took place at the Munich airport during the recent IAA Mobility auto show, where the team demonstrated their exceptional engineering prowess. The test spanned six days, during which the team resided in an airplane hangar, attesting to their dedication. To secure this record, the TUfast Eco team enhanced their vehicle called the "muc022," which was previously used in competitions for electric cars. Their focus was on aerodynamic design and lightweight construction. They also integrated a larger battery with an output rating of 15.5 kilowatt hours, bringing the vehicle into the realm of world records. The Munich airport played a pivotal role by providing an empty airplane hangar, ensuring that the record attempt could proceed regardless of weather conditions. The previous record stood at 1,608.54 kilometers, a mark the TUM team surpassed in only four days. They continued driving until the battery was nearly depleted, ultimately achieving an impressive distance of 2,573.79 kilometers after 99 hours on the road. Remarkably, the TUfast Eco team consumed only 0.6 kilowatt hours to cover 100 kilometers, an outstanding energy efficiency compared to conventional vehicles, which typically require around 13 kWh for the same distance. Bavarian Science Minister Markus Blume congratulated the team, acknowledging their exceptional achievement. He : "World record for TUM! Congratulations to the TUfast Eco Team on this terrific success. We are proud of the students. They make up the unique TUM spirit. And we are proud of our top university, which demands and promotes a pioneering mindset," "At TUM, the motto is: study and try. The result: International engineering art made in Bavaria. With the world record, our students are not only demonstrating sporting ambition. There is more behind it: They want to shape the future of mobility in a sustainable way," he added. In , ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts students have shattered the previous world record for electric vehicle acceleration. Their custom-built electric racing car called "mythen" accelerated from zero to 100 km/h in an astonishing 0.956 seconds, covering a distance of just 12.3 meters. They navigated through obstacles and repeatedly revisited the drawing board to fine-tune specific components. Guinness World Records has officially recognized "mythen" as the new world record holder for EV acceleration. This feat was recently achieved at the Switzerland Innovation Park in Duebendorf, Switzerland, opposite the students' workshop. The car, driven by Kate Maggetti, sprinted from a standstill to 100 km/h (or 62.15 mph) in an astonishing 0.956 seconds, surpassing the previous record set by a team from the University of Stuttgart in September 2022 by over a third. These accomplishments underscore the exceptional capabilities of student-driven innovation in the realm of electric vehicles.
