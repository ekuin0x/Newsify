                The Republic of Ireland's hopes of qualifying for Euro 2024 have been all but ended by the Netherlands after Dutch substitute Wout Weghorst scored to secure a 2-1 win in Dublin. The hosts, in need of victory to put themselves in contention in Group B, took the lead on four minutes when Adam Idah scored from the penalty spot after Virgil van Dijk had been penalised for handball. Cody Gakpo levelled 15 minutes later from another penalty before Weghorst ensured his side moved second with a game in hand behind leaders France when he scored after 56 minutes to leave the Republic requiring a Dutch collapse if they are to progress. Elsewhere in the group, Greece beat Gibraltar 5-0 in Athens to remain in the race for the second qualifying spot. Dimitrios Pelkas opened the scoring after nine minutes before Konstantinos Mavropanos followed up midway through the half with the first of two goals. Giorgos Masouras netted after the break, before both he and Mavropanos each grabbed another to seal the victory and put the hosts level with the Dutch on nine points, albeit having played a game more. Northern Ireland fell to a 1-0 defeat in Kazakhstan, their fourth by the same scoreline in a run of five straight losses, to leave their qualification hopes virtually extinguished. Kazakhstan are one of four teams separated by a point at the top of Group H, with Denmark leading the way thanks to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's 86th-minute strike to seal a 1-0 win away in Finland. It meant the Danes briefly replaced their hosts at the top of the group, before being knocked into second on goal difference after Slovenia won 4-0 in San Marino. Poland's hopes of reaching the finals received a serious knock as they lost for the third time in five games in Group E, going down 2-0 in Albania. Jasir Asani and Mirlind Daku scored either side of half-time in Tirana to send Albania two points clear of the Czech Republic at the top of the group. Moldova are behind the Czechs on goal difference after they kept up their surprise bid to reach the finals with a 1-0 win in the Faroe Islands. In Group G, Montenegro and Serbia kept up the pressure on leaders Hungary in a three-way fight to qualify. Montenegro needed a goal six minutes into added time from Stevan Jovetic to snatch a 2-1 win against Bulgaria in Podgorica despite having played more than 30 minutes with 10 players. Aleksandar Mitrovic score a first-half hat-trick as Serbia coasted to a 3-1 win in Lithuania.
