                t is just before 10am and does not want to be here. He made the mistake, he confesses, of sleeping last night with the curtains closed. He slips into acting mode and does a funny impression of a groggy man being jolted awake. Now he craves daylight. So we abandon Off the Record, a basement bar at Washingtons venerable Hay-Adams hotel, and head up to a room on the third floor. Penns publicist hastily wheels room service breakfast out of the way and apologises for her unmade bed. The 63-year-old actor settles into an armchair by an open window, sunlight exploring light and shade on his chiselled features. He drinks a bottle of Sprite and says contentedly, Whatever time you need,  words guaranteed to make his scheduler nervous. Penn is in the nations capital to promote , a documentary he co-directed about Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the resilience of the Ukrainian people following the Russian invasion. After a screening of the film, Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the House of Representatives, held him in a long embrace as she told him: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Not everyone is so gracious about Hollywood actors dabbling in geopolitical affairs. Celebrity status opens doors and closes minds. Anyone who was around in the 1980s may remember Penn as the guy who played stoner and surfer Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, spent 33 days in jail for assaulting an extra, and married and divorced Madonna. Four decades later, his hair is white but he is still a big name method actor with Oscars for Mystic River (2003) and Milk (2008). A profile opined that in Superpower theres a bit too much Sean Penn doing Sean Penn things in a war zone. Penn anticipates this kind of thing in the film when he parodies an imaginary critic by asking: Who do you think you are  Walter Cronkite? Do you have a saviour complex? His answer: Im curious  and sometimes I feel I can be helpful. He has receipts to prove it. Frustrated by the search and rescue efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, , reached survivors, gave them money and took some of them to hospital. In 2010, after an earthquake left thousands homeless in Haiti, , launched a charitable organisation and lived in the country for months at a time. Today, wearing dark jacket, blue shirt, blue jeans and white trainers, and situated just a three-minute walk from the White House, Penn addresses scepticism of his humanitarian work by reaching for an aphorism: I dream of a world where chickens can cross the road without having their motives questioned. He elaborates: People are willing to admire actors up to a point. But then its going to be the cliche: all of them are rich. The celebrity versus the actor or the artist, or whatever it is. I dont have any more time to defend myself against that. Ive been in a lot of interesting places, and Ive been able to experience them in a unique way because of access. And also because  even when I have specifically been doing what would fall under journalism  I dont feel any obligation to a style of journalism that requires more than my talent allows. My talent is that Im interested. As much flak as Ive gotten, Ive archived almost none of it visually. Because I know if theres a camera with me, well, thats what Im doing, right? Thats the assumption: Oh, hes trying to get pictures taken of himself. Penn did not originally intend to be on camera in Superpower, but then he hit a wall trying to get the film financed. So viewers see him conversing with Zelenskiy, walking the deserted streets of Kyiv on the night of the invasion, and unburdening his security detail (Can I be very blunt? Youre Sean Penn, nobodys going to be responsible for your dying on the front lines) by leaving them behind as he follows Ukrainian soldiers to trenches evocative of the Somme. Penn, who made seven trips to , points out: Docs are pretty hard to get money for now. [It wouldve been hard to fund] unless I was on camera. So you know what? This time Im just going to let anybody who wants to, to jump in my backpack and see what I see. The twist in the actor-activists story is that the chief subject of his film is an actor-politician. Superpower neatly curates archival clips of Zelenskiys past as a comedy star who played a piano with his penis and who, in the series , played a fictional Ukrainian president. With echoes of Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, he demonstrated the potency of on-screen charisma when running for election against the political status quo. It was this aspect that first intrigued Penn, after planned film projects on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and murdered Saudi journalist failed to get off the ground. On the surface, maybe the world was moving into , he says of Zelenskiy. But thats not what I encountered with him. There was something interactive that had happened in that country , where the Ukraine that one would perceive from the outside was being reinvented by young people and their young president. Has Zelenskiys talent as a performer been important to and winning the communications war with the Kremlin? Id say that the performer was helped by a generous heart that wanted to share  which led him to become a performer. The actor stuff is the easy go to. They did it with Reagan. Penn lowers his voice and does a fine impression of film director : Its one thing to have an actor in the White House. Quite another a actor. He continues in his own voice: The Ukrainians have a really good actor in their palace and before he was a good actor he was a good communicator. And he was a good communicator because he saw in people what really existed and what mattered, and saw it through the lens of humour and courage as a man. He has met this challenge as the Ukrainians have met this challenge, in a way that is inspiring to the world. We should not let it go. Its important medicine for all of us right now. Due to delays caused by the pandemic, Penn did not meet Zelenskiy in person until 23 February last year. Filming for Superpower began the following day  the same day . Some Ukrainians interviewed by Penn doubted that Zelenskiy possessed the steeliness necessary to defy Vladimir Putin. But meeting Zelenskiy in the bunker of the presidential palace, Penn found Prince Hal transmogrified into Henry V. Its as if he was born for this moment. It was very moving. There are certainly great, brave leaders on all the continents today  but not with an enemy next door with nuclear weapons. This is a new paradigm. Penns admiration for Zelenskiy  whom he gave one of his Oscars to keep for the duration of the war  is matched only by his disregard for . I would not react differently to Putins death by natural means than I would, lets say, if he were stripped naked and burned bit by bit to death by cigarettes and had people defecate on him until he had nothing else to eat. It would be the same. I dont count him among us. Wary of provoking Putin into a conflict that could spiral into a third world war, the wests initial response was incremental. But slowly it has turned up the dial. By July of this year, the US had given to Ukraine, and indicated that it would allow European allies to provide American-made F-16 fighter aircraft. Penn, who has lobbied for the jets, believes that more decisive, more complete action is necessary. I use the word cowardice because I do not know any other word to describe what happens when we argue caution as restraint. Restraint looks like John F Kennedy holding back military action during  that is a powerful piece of leadership. Caution looks like, Im scared the bad guys are going to do something if I do whats right, so lets do nothing. Or lets do just enough that wont get me more scared. He adds: The good news is that the Ukrainians, both in leadership and on the ground, have not entirely lost faith in us. And while certainly one could get lost in the fact that there have been so many unnecessary deaths  and I believe this war would have been over had decisive action been taken  I dont think its too late to take decisive action. Im talking about doing everything it takes to arm them with everything they need to let know that they can play tough, too. Trump  the front-runner for the Republican partys presidential nomination  and a prominent faction of his party are increasingly questioning support for Ukraine, making it into just one more contentious battleground in Americas polarised politics. What Superpower throws into sharp relief, meanwhile, is the sense of unity and national identity that Ukrainians have forged under threat from an external foe. It made Penn see his own country anew. It was like breathing a different kind of air. I knew we had problems and divisions, and that the fragile aspiration of America was in great peril. said he had to play an A chord once for half an hour before he heard it. This was the first time I realised how much we need that unity, that feeling. He laments: We dont love each other in this country. We dont like each other in this country. Were nasty to each other. We fear each other, and were trading courage for cowardice and not realising that, in doing so, were also trading away something that all of us need, which is that were social animals and we want community. The data is in around the world: where longevity exists, community exists. We experience it ourselves. We know that the times in our life that we are happy are because, whether in the micro or macro, theres a moment of community. For all the horror of 9/11, something felt good, didnt it? Because we didnt question each other. We knew what we had in common and that bonded us. Penn flies a big US and a big Ukrainian flag at his home in Malibu, California. Im a big proponent of the idea that we start waving our flags again, even if were on the left, and we not worry that our neighbours are going to think we suddenly became a Maga hawk  which is what some of my friends accuse me of. Ukrainian flags are less visible around the US these days. Attention spans are short and for the war effort. Zelenskiy is heading to Washington this week to test his star power against the fragility of the moment. Before last Thursdays screening, Penn admitted to the audience: As a film-maker, I would say that one always worries that somehow the projector is going to break. I hope that doesnt happen. Superpower is available to stream on Paramount+
