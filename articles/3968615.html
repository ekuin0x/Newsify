                has said Scottish ministers are taking the issue of Chinas influence in Scotland seriously amid the arrest of a parliamentary researcher accused of spying for the foreign state. The said the allegations should give us all concern but moved to reassure the public that ministers have been taking precautionary measures against similar threats for years. It comes after it emerged a researcher was one of two men arrested in March under the Official Secrets Act, accused of spying on behalf of China. The man has denied the allegations. Weve been alive to these threats and are taking the appropriate precautionary measures, and have been for a number of years Speaking during a visit to CodeBase in Stirling, Mr Yousaf said: Of course, any threat to our security and cybersecurity is one we take very seriously, and I know from conversations with the UK that they take it seriously too, and therefore the various agencies that are involved work and collaborate very well, so theres already a significant amount of work thats done to ensure that we identify where those threats come from and that we take the appropriate mitigation action. SPONSORED The First Ministers comments come as Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton called for the Scottish and UK governments to conduct an immediate strategic audit on the reach of Chinas influence in Scotland. Mr Cole-Hamilton urged Mr Yousaf not to be complacent in the face of national security threats. Mr Yousaf told journalists that while the news of the arrest was concerning, Government officials were taking the necessary precautions. He said: It, of course, should give us all concern, but it is a live investigation at the moment. We know there are a number of hostile actors, a number of hostile states, who will try to threaten our security, indeed our cybersecurity, and I think thats where its really important that the public receives a level of reassurance that weve been alive to these threats and are taking the appropriate precautionary measures, and have been for a number of years. Mr Cole-Hamilton said: I am deeply troubled by these reports which suggest worrying evidence of interference in the operation of our parliamentary democracy. Scottish Liberal Democrats have been warning about the reach of Chinese influence for some time now. We cannot afford to be complacent in the face of national security threats. To this end, I would like to see a commitment from both our governments to conduct an immediate strategic audit of the reach of Chinas influence in Scotland.
