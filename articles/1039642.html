                Former ONE strawweight world titleholder Joshua Pacio is hoping to share the cage one more time with reigning champion Jarred Brooks should he overcome the challenge that is Mansur Malachiev. Pacio, 20-4 as a professional mixed martial artist, is scheduled to face the unbeaten prospect from Dagestan on the undercard of ONE Fight Night 15 on October 7 at Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Bangkok, Thailand. "For me, there is no such thing as an easy fight," Pacio stated during an online press conference by ONE Championship. "We always treat competition like it is the last fight of our careers especially now that I am facing the ranked [no.] five and undefeated Malachiev. I will make sure that I go there at a hundred percent. Hopefully, the winner gets a title shot." It has been almost a year since the 27-year-old Pacio last saw action inside the cage. in front of his hometown crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. A lots has happened since that fateful night, including a training tour in the USA and a change of stable to Lions Nation MMA. Now more confident in his grappling thanks to their in-house jiu-jitsu coach Gibran Langbayan, Pacio says he is ready for Malachiev. "Malachiev is a different breed of wrestler and grappler, but I believe I have fought the best wrestler in my division that is Jarred Brooks. I do not underestimate Malachiev, he is undefeated and ranked five for a reason. We are preparing for his wrestling," Pacio said.
