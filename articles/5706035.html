                EXCLUSIVE: Michigan Republican dares GOP rebels to refuse their paycheck if they block spending bills and shut the government down as battle brews over ousting McCarthy GOP Rep. John James has a new government accountability package that would deny members paychecks if the government shuts down Shutdown prospects loom after Congress returned this week and conservative McCarthy opponents held up a vote on defense appropriations 'Freedom Caucus has been around since 2014. We've increased our debt by $10 trillion since they've been here. Now all of a sudden this is an issue,' he By Morgan Phillips, U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 11:30 EDT, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 11:31 EDT, 15 September 2023 e-mail View comments GOP Rep. John James tore into his rabble-rousing Freedom Caucus colleagues for holding up spending legislation and forcing the government on the edge of a shutdown. ' The Freedom Caucus has been around since 2014. We've increased our debt by $10 trillion since they've been here. Now all of a sudden this is an issue,' he told DailyMail.com after a vote on the conservative defense appropriations bill was canned when right-wing members said they would vote against it in protest. And while both parties typically go to great lengths to project a unified front, patience is wearing thin with the silent majority of the House Republican conference. GOP Rep. John James tore into his rabble-rousing Freedom Caucus colleagues for holding up spending legislation and forcing the government on the edge of a shutdown 'People seem to be fixated a lot more on the 10 percent of those who can never seem to be satisfied than the 90 percent, the 200 of us, who voted with Kevin McCarthy 15 times,' he said. 'We see cutting wasteful spending and keeping the government running as a higher priority than political fundraising.' That came after McCarthy launched an impeachment inquiry in a move that typically would have appeased the right wing - but instead scored new threats to his speakership. 'Move the f***ing motion,' was McCarthy's message in a meeting Thursday to the handful of members threatening to bring up a motion to vacate to oust him. Meanwile, the Michigan congressman and former Army aviator has proposed a new package of government accountability legislation - and is daring his right-wing colleagues to refuse their paycheck if they run the government into a shutdown. 'If you feel so strongly about it, don't take a paycheck, with your staff not taking paycheck. Don't take a paycheck while you're shutting down essential services like veterans' hotlines that may save lives,' he went on. One of his bills would force Congress to go without pay at every government shutdown. Shutdown prospects loom large after Congress returned to Washington this week but made no progress on passing spending legislation ahead of the September 30 deadline. Another pair of resolutions would amend the constitution to put an age limit on 75 for running for federal office and a term limit at 18 years - proposals that have gained major traction outside Washington but so far had little sway over the American gerontocracy. ' The Freedom Caucus has been around since 2014. We've increased our debt by $10 trillion since they've been here. Now all of a sudden this is an issue,' he told DailyMail.com Both leading candidates in the 2024 presidential race - Joe Biden and Donald Trump, who James has endorsed - would be disqualified if his legislation were made law. But he declined to say specifically whether they are fit to serve. 'I do believe that we have a minimum age, I think we should have a maximum age,' the congressman said. James said he is on a campaign to make the federal government look more like the private sector. He noted that three-quarters of the S&P 500 have mandatory retirement age limits, typically around 70. The military mandates retirement at age 62 except for generals, chaplains or health practitioners and federal courts across the U.S. have varying mandatory retirement ages. 'Part of the reason why we're seeing ballooning student debt with no accountability for universities, the reason we're seeing mental health issues among students, the reason why we see massive debt into north of $30 trillion mark, is because we don't have enough young people who can speak for the future.' Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney echoed a similar sentiment when he announced he would retire at the end of his term because he would be too old to be in office. 'I think it's time for guys like me to get out of the way,' the 76-year-old said. The fourth prong of James' government accountability legislation would bring back Schedule F - a classification of federal workers that are hired on an at-will contract and are stripped of union and civil protections that he says make it hard to fire poor performers. Trump signed an executive order creating the Schedule F classification shortly before leaving office, but it was never widely implemented and Biden did away with it when he came to the White House. 'Biden did zero analysis when he came in and slashed and burned everything that looked smelled or tasted like the previous administration,' said James. 'Orange man bad is terrible policy making.' After a six-week recess the House returned Tuesday and was in session for less than 48 hours before jetting home again - without passing a single of the 12 appropriations bills that have a September 30 deadline. McCarthy expressed to members they would need a short-term continuing resolution (CR), to push past the deadline. But members of the House Freedom Caucus have launched a fiery opposition to that idea. GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz , Fla., said that putting a CR on the floor would be 'shot, chaser' where he would immediately move to push the speaker out of his job. Even if the House were to pass all 12 appropriations bills, it's highly unlikely that they would be able to come to agreement with the Democratic-led Senate. The next option would be to pass a long term CR or an omnibus, like what happened last Congress. If lawmakers punt spending deadlines until after the new year, an automatic one percent cut kicks in as agreed to in the Biden-McCarthy debt limit deal.
