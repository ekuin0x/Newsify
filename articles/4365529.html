                The decision of the leaders of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (I.N.D.I.A) to not attend debate shows of 14 anchors has taken a political turn with BJP and opposition questioning each other on the issue of press freedom. Former Karnataka Chief Minister and Congress leader Siddaramaiah shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, and listed the names of some journalists who were "arrested", "killed" for reporting the truth. The leader also highlighted the declining rank of India in the Press Freedom Index from 2015 to 2023. "Mr. @JPNadda avare, We will give you the data on the actual attack on the media. You may have forgotten this, but INDIA still remembers it. Journalists who were arrested for reporting the truth: -Siddique Kappan -Mohammed Zubair -Ajit Ojha -Jaspal Singh -Sajad Gul -Kishorechandra Wangkhen -Prashant Kanojia..," the post read.

He named Rakesh Singh of Uttar Pradesh who reported on the misappropriation of government funds, among others. "Shubham Mani Tripathi, Uttar Pradesh, Report on Sand Trafficking, G Moses, Tamil Nadu, report on illegal sale of Goma, Report on Parag Bhuyan, Assam, SI recruitment scam, Gauri Lankesh, for opposing communalism," he wrote. His response came after BJP National President JP Nadda accused the Congress of "bullying the media" and "silencing those with differing views". "The history of Congress has many instances of bullying the media and silencing those with differing views. Pandit Nehru curtailed free speech and arrested those who criticised him. Indira Ji remains the Gold Medal winner of how to do it- called for committed judiciary, committed bureaucracy and imposed the horrific Emergency," Nadda said in a post on X.

Indira Ji remains the Gold Medal winner of how to do it- called for committed judiciary,  Jagat Prakash Nadda (@JPNadda) September 14, 2023 "Rajiv Ji tried to bring media under state control but failed miserably. Sonia Ji-led UPA was banning social media handles simply because the Congress did not like their views," he added. 'PM Modi Has Boycotted Every Indian Journalists' Reacting to Nadda's accusations, Siddaramaiah said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has boycotted every Indian journalist by not addressing a single press conference in the last 10 years. "How is it wrong to boycott 14 journalists who have compromised media ethics by acting as mouthpiece of one political party?" he asked. Recalling the ban on the BBC documentary on the Gujarat riots, Siddaramaiah said, "The fact that a party does not come to the news media and does not participate in the debate is not a violation of freedom of expression. Banning of BBC Documentary on Prime Minister @narendramodi is a real attack on freedom of expression!!"  @JPNadda ,       .   ,   .     :             pic.twitter.com/drU4uoVsyo  Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) September 15, 2023 He also quoted India's declining stand on the Press Freedom Index and said: "Press Freedom Index: Falling India's Rank 2015: 136th position 2019: 140th position 2022: 150th position 2023: 161st position What does @BJP4India have to say about this?"
