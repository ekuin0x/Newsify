                Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever, was Alabama Gov. George Wallaces (D) It would be great if attitudes like that were buried long ago in the landfill of racist history. But looking at Alabama today, it can feel like not much has changed. Taking a page right out of Wallaces 60-year-old playbook, Republican state legislators against a direct order from the Supreme Court to redraw racially gerrymandered electoral maps that disadvantage Black voters. The legislature and finally responded to the courts with one hitch  legislators freely admit that it doesnt meet the requirements for an additional majority-Black district. Earlier this month, judges on a federal district court panel threw out the new map and made a point of writing that they were the legislators deliberate nose-thumbing. That was good news. But these Alabama lawmakers clearly think they can win by losing, because now they can appeal to the Supreme Court again. The Alabama House Speaker, unafraid to say the quiet part out loud, declared that since the courts ruling against them last time was 5-4, that needs to see something different for them to win this time around. Meanwhile, a federal court is ordering that yet another district map be drawn up by a . (When was the last time you heard of a cartographer?) The dispute sends the states redistricting process back almost to square one. And if it isnt resolved in time, And if anybody thought Alabama was alone in trying to turn back the clock, Florida has jumped into the fray. Just days before the federal court in Alabama rejected the legislatures new map, a state judge in Florida That plan also would disenfranchise Black voters. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) . Other states, including , , and , are embroiled in court cases over their maps, too. There are probably plenty of people who will brush this off as just politics. But for millions of Americans, this is personal. And painful. A couple of weeks ago I had the honor to speak at the . Im a millennial, and in , I told the crowd what I know in my heart: that my entire life was made possible by the people who fought 60 years ago for me. To see voting rights under attack again all these years later is a gut punch. So we do what civil rights advocates did decades ago, and we fight. Back in the 1960s, the remedy was federal legislation. It can be again; there have been two bills in Congress recently that are designed to protect voting rights against attacks, including redistricting abuses like the ones were seeing in places like Alabama and Florida. These bills, the and the , came really as a package before GOP opposition and failure to reform the filibuster . But that doesnt mean giving up; the Freedom to Vote Act . The John Lewis Act will be, too, as its sponsor Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) . Sewell, of course, is from Alabama  the eye of the storm. And while there might not be much chance that the current GOP-controlled House will do the right thing on voting rights  not when Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) falsely the latest Alabama map scheme to redistricting in  we keep fighting. We can thank the courts for handing voters a partial victory with rulings against racist maps. But the real victory needs to come next November when we go to the polls with a clear focus: Only vote for those who will protect our voting rights. .
