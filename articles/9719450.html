                Michael Beale says it is time for Rangers to do the talking on the park as he highlighted the importance of a response to make it up to the fans. The suffered a week to forget before the international break as they crashed out of the qualifying route at the play-off round after a thumping defeat to PSV. After a 2-2 draw, the duo went head to head in a do or die clash in Eindhoven with the Eredivisie side smashing the Ibrox side 5-1 to progress to Europe's top table and land the riches that comes with competing against the best. It was then the first derby of the season at a packed out Ibrox of home supporters as and his side arrived amid a defensive crisis in Govan. But it was , as he so often does, who had the big say on derby day as his stunning effort just before the break earned the champions all three points and ramp the pressure right up on the Ibrox gaffer. They lunchtime against St Johnstone with a massive response required. knows as much and says there is not much time for talking and the answers need to come ON the pitch. He's been happy with the response of his players in training and now it is time to put that into practice at McDiarmid Park ahead of a busy period in the fixture schedule with Europa League action and a Viaplay Cup last eight clash just around the corner. He told the media at his press conference: "There has been a lot of reflection, some good training on the pitch and we have seen a good response from the players. It is important we put this into a performance. "It was disappointing the way two big games went, that is the reality of it. We reflect and are aware there are certainly some things we need to improve on. "Ultimately, you need to win games of football. This year is about picking up silverware, we have not started the season how we wanted but there is a lot of football to be played. "There is not much time for talking now, we need to make it up to our support on the pitch. "The team needs to win games of football and show a rhythm in how we play. It is now important we have a response."
