                Pensioners could be in for a bumper rise next year after it was announced that the growth in wages has continued to soar. Under the triple lock system pensions go up each April by whichever of these three things is highest: inflation according to the Consumer Prices Index the previous September, average increase in wages across the UK or 2.5%. According to figures released today average regular weekly earnings growth remained at a record high of 7.8% in the three months to July, matching Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation for the first time since October 2021. Total pay including bonuses jumped by 8.5%, meaning that it exceeded inflation for the first time since March 2022, up 0.6% with CPI taken into account. This could mean that pension are also set to rise by 8.5 per cent next April under the triple lock rules. This would see the state pension for men born after April 1951 and women born after April 1953 shoot up 901 from 10,600 to 11,501. For those born before this, the full basic state pension will go up 690 from 8,122 to 8,812, the Mirror reported . The rises will take effect in April next year. It is the second bumper rise in a row, with pensions going up by 10.1% in April, due to high inflation the previous September. The triple lock protection means the state pension rises each year in line with the highest out of 2.5%, wage rises or inflation. The figures also showed that the rate of unemployment lifted to its highest level for nearly two years, at 4.3% in the three months to July, up from 4.2% in the previous three months. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said: Earnings in cash terms continue to increase at a record rate outside the pandemic-affected period. Coupled with lower inflation, this means peoples real pay is no longer falling. Unemployment continues to increase in the latest three months. Correspondingly, employment is down, driven by falls among men and the self-employed. The proportion of people neither working nor looking for a job is slightly up, with more students, as well as the long-term sick reaching yet another record. Regular wages have been trailing behind inflation for nearly two years, with earnings failing to match up to sky-high rises in the cost of living. But the record leap in earnings is also likely to raise concerns among Bank of England policymakers over a wage-price spiral and may increase pressure to raise interest rates further as they battle to bring inflation back to its 2% target. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: Its heartening to see the number of employees on payroll is still close to record highs and that our unemployment rate remains below many of our international peers. Wage growth remains high, partly reflecting one-off payments to public sector workers, but for real wages to grow sustainably we must stick to our plan to halve inflation. The latest wage growth figures are also particularly important, as the total earnings rise is used to determine the triple lock guarantee for the state pension  which increases every April in line with the highest of average earnings growth in the year from May to July of the previous year, CPI inflation in September of the previous year, and 2.5%. This means that state earnings are set to leap by 8.5% next April, although the ONS stressed the wage growth figures are subject to possible future revisions. This would mean that a full basic state pension rises from its current 156.20 per week to 169.50, while a full new state pension  which those who have reached state pension age since April 2016 receive  would rise from 203.85 per week to 221.20, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The latest data also revealed that the number of vacancies fell below the million mark for the first time since the summer of 2021, down 64,000 in the three months to August to 989,000, although the ONS said they remain above pre-Covid levels. More timely figures show the number of workers on UK payrolls edged 1,000 lower to 30.1 million, the ONS said.
