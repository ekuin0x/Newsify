                Alison Hammond wears budget clothes on This Morning - and it's even rubbing off on Holly Ms Hammond, 48, opts for cheaper outfits – some costing less than £40 A hot pink dress the star wore in the summer cost just £28 from ASOS By Katie Hind Published: 18:06 BST, 9 September 2023 | Updated: 18:12 BST, 9 September 2023 e-mail 7 shares View comments As the most sought-after woman in television, Alison Hammond is inundated with lucrative work offers. But when it comes to her This Morning wardrobe, the down-to-earth star prefers to keep things low budget. While many of her fellow stars prefer to wear designer clothes in front of the camera, Ms Hammond, 48, opts for cheaper outfits – some costing less than £40. And her affordable taste appears to have rubbed off on co-presenter Holly Willoughby , who swapped her usual high-end wardrobe for a modest High Street look when the pair appeared on screen together last week. Alison Hammond, wearing a £60 pink and cream swirly two-piece from I Saw It First, with This Morning co-host Holly Willoughby. Ms Hammond's green two-piece shirt and trouser suit that she wore alongside Holly last Monday cost £43 from ASOS, one of her favourite clothing retailers A hot pink dress the star wore in the summer cost just £28 from ASOS and she matched it with a baby pink blazer from High Street shop River Island, priced at £65 Ms Hammond’s green two-piece shirt and trouser suit that she wore alongside Holly last Monday cost £43 from ASOS, one of her favourite clothing retailers. The top set her back just £22 while the trousers were snapped up in the sale for £21, down from £28. On Tuesday she went for another two-piece – this time a pink and cream swirly number – which came to a total of £60 from online shop I Saw It First. Another favourite of Ms Hammond’s is a blue shirt and trouser suit which cost £86 from Manchester-based wholesaler NaaNaa. A hot pink dress the star wore in the summer cost just £28 from ASOS and she matched it with a baby pink blazer from High Street shop River Island, priced at £65. Once again, she went for ASOS for a stand out orange jacket and matching trousers with cost £40 and £19.50 and has worn numerous jackets and shirts from the popular online retailer. Ms Hammond went for ASOS for a stand out orange jacket and matching trousers with cost £40 and £19.50 and has worn numerous jackets and shirts from the popular online retailer In June Ms Hammond also wore a green leaf print shirt and matching trousers from another of her favourite shops, Yours, which came to £38.98. Among Ms Hammond’s most expensive garments on screen are from German shop Ulla Popken where their oversized shirts and pull on trousers sell for around £120 per outfit. Ms Hammond and Ms Willoughby, wearing a £130 polka dot dress from Pure Collection, on the ITV show on Monday A source close to Ms Hammond said: ‘Alison loves bright clothes and she embraces her curves. She loves seeking outfits out, she does very occasionally use a stylist but generally does things herself because that’s the kind of person she is.’ By contrast, Ms Willoughby, 42, is well-known for wearing designer clothes on This Morning. Last May, in what was one of her last appearances on the show with disgraced former co-star Phillip Schofield, she wore a yellow dress from luxury fashion label Beulah which cost £720. But she dramatically tones down her look when she presents the programme with Ms Hammond. Last Monday, to mark her comeback after her summer holiday, she wore a polka dot dress from Pure Collection which costs £130. The next day she wore a £75 navy soft denim number from And Other Stories.
