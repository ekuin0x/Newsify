Citing data on natural disasters from Candid and the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, this study notes that the number, intensity, and cost of natural disasters has risen significantly. Between 2016 and 2020, an estimated $1.77 billion in private philanthropic funding was directed globally toward responding to natural disasters with 37 percent of this amount originating from companies or company-affiliated foundations. (Natural disasters were defined as including drought, earthquake, tsunami, flood, mass movement, storm, extreme temperature, volcano, and wildfire.) Since 2020, 53 percent of companies have increased the number of disasters they respond to, and 61 percent have increased their total disaster philanthropy giving levels  and they expect this trend to continue. The growing threat of disasters is considered by companies to be closely linked to climate change and nearly 90 percent of company executives expect climate change to significantly affect their businesses over the next five years. While immediate relief is the primary focus of corporate disaster philanthropy  with 96 percent of companies committing resources to immediate needs  a growing number of firms include funding for disaster preparedness, which is particularly important for building resilience in vulnerable communities and reducing the need for immediate relief after a disaster strikes. Sixty-five percent of companies also contribute in-kind goods and services, such as essential supplies, equipment, or professional services.

The report suggests that firms could better prepare to respond to disasters by mapping their equipment, facilities, networks, technical expertise, and intellectual property against potential disaster needs in target communities. There is also significant potential for companies to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of their disaster response efforts through collaboration with peer companies. While nearly 90 percent of companies collaborate with international, national, and local humanitarian organizations, only 28 percent of firms have partnered with other for-profit entities when responding to disasters. And only 43 percent of the 100 companies surveyed routinely monitor and evaluate the impact of their disaster giving and less than half of companies currently undertake strategic planning for potential future disasters. More companies could improve the impact of their disaster response efforts by establishing clear criteria to determine when and how to respond to specific disasters and incorporate these criteria into internal protocols to promote more rational and timely decision-making. The survey found that the three most important determinants for responding to a disaster are: the proximity to company operations, the human toll of the disaster, and employee pressure and expectations. While we know that employees are an increasing driver of corporate action on environmental and social issues, we were surprised by just how many firms (93 percent) cited employees as a leading stakeholder group influencing or shaping their disaster involvement, said Andrew Jones, Senior Researcher at The Conference Board ESG Center. Furthermore, over 80 percent expect employees to exert an even stronger influence over the next five years. Increasing employee expectations and activism is clearly a trend that is here to stay  especially as more Generation Z employees enter the workforce. Companies could consider finding other ways of channeling the power and enthusiasm of their employees by actively involving more of them in the decision-making process, providing more support for their fundraising efforts, and encouraging and rewarding their skills-based volunteerism. The report concludes by highlighting the fact that corporate employees might also be the victims of natural disasters and many companies have established funds to support them during times of disasters. This is often accomplished by facilitating and matching the contributions of other employees, providing mental health resources, facilitating flexible schedules, coordinating employee volunteers, and providing direct support services to these impacted employees and their families. Almost 70 percent of companies provide direct financial assistance through an employee relief fund, which is supported by contributions from both the company and its employees, and operates with a structured process centered around eligibility, applications and grant-making. Natural disasters have always been, and will always be, a part of life in many vulnerable communities. But their frequency and complexity continue to increase as climate change impacts different geographic localities and regions. Corporate leaders expect to see more disasters impacting their businesses, communities, and employees in the future, so they are changing the ways that they prepare and respond to these events.
