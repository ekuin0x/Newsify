                In his keynote speech to the TUC Congress in Liverpool, general secretary Paul Nowak will claim that nothing works in this country anymore and no-one in Government cares. BREAKING: We are reporting the UK government to the United Nations watchdog on workers' rights over their anti-strikes law.  Trades Union Congress (@The_TUC) He will say: Theyve had 13 years to sort out crumbling concrete in our schools, but five days before the new term they tell schools they cant open. Because  and I quote the Education Secretary  everyone sat on their arses. Could you think of a more perfect metaphor for this Government? A crisis of their making, but someone else gets the blame. Yet, this Government that cant keep our rivers clean, or run trains on time, or run a functioning NHS can find time to attack the right to strike. Mr Nowak attacked the controversial new law on strikes, which will be debated at the conference on Monday. He will say: The right to strike is fundamental. Without the right to withdraw our labour workers, become disposable, replaceable and exploitable. This new law isnt about preserving services for the public. Its about telling us to get back in our place and to not demand better. Well, thats not going to happen  not on our watch. We fought their attack on the right to strike in parliament and well fight it at the ILO (International Labour Organisation) and in the courts. When the first worker is sacked for refusing to work on a strike day, well fight it in workplaces and on the picket lines. This movement will fight it every single day until it is repealed. The TUC is reporting the Government to the United Nations workers rights watchdog over the new law. Mr Nowak said the union body would be lodging the case at the ILO because the legislation on ensuring minimum levels of service during industrial action falls far short of international legal standards.
