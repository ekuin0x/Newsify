                Former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir didn't hold back when expressing his criticism of Babar Azam's captaincy during Pakistan's Super Four defeat to Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup 2023. This pivotal match ended with Pakistan being eliminated from the tournament, while Sri Lanka secured their spot in the final showdown against India on Sunday, September 17. In a match marked by rain interruptions, Pakistan, after winning the toss, opted to bat in a game reduced to 45 overs per side due to weather conditions. However, their struggles persisted as opener Fakhar Zaman could only muster 4 runs. A brief partnership of 64 runs between Babar Azam (29) and Abdullah Shafique (52) provided some respite for Pakistan. But their fortunes took a downturn after Babar's dismissal in the 16th over, leaving Pakistan at 130/5 after 27.4 overs. Rain disrupted the game once more, further reducing the contest to 42 overs per side. Following the rain break, Mohammad Rizwan's exceptional unbeaten 86 and Iftikhar Ahmed's contribution of 47 played a pivotal role in Pakistan's resurgence. Together, they stitched a dynamic 108-run partnership for the sixth wicket, infusing crucial momentum and guiding Pakistan to a competitive total of 252/7 in 42 overs. In response, Sri Lanka's chase was anchored by Kusal Mendis, who delivered an impressive 91 runs, setting a strong foundation for their pursuit. However, late wickets from Iftikhar and Shaheen Afridi added tension to the final overs. Nevertheless, Charith Asalanka's composed innings of 49* ultimately secured the victory for Sri Lanka. In a post-match discussion on Star Sports, Gautam Gambhir openly critiqued Babar Azam's captaincy, particularly in the closing stages of the game, and raised questions about Babar's field placements. He highlighted concerns about Babar's leadership, especially during the partnership between Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama, suggesting the need for a more assertive approach in the middle overs. Gambhir's remarks have ignited conversations surrounding Babar Azam's leadership abilities and strategic decision-making as Pakistan evaluates its performance in the Asia Cup campaign.
