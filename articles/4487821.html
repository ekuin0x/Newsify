                With fall just one week away, temperatures in the Okanagan are feeling more like the middle of summer, causing a spike in fire activity. With this weather, were seeing an increase in activity in a majority of fires in the Kamloops Fire Centre, said Fire Information Officer, Shaelee Stearns. A lot of this activity is happening within the fire perimeter on some of our larger incidents, specifically incidents with being held or under control status. Since the increased fire activity is within the perimeter its not expected to spread beyond that. Planned ignitions will be used on incidents to secure the perimeter around the fire, said Stearns. When there are pockets of unburnt fuel well within the fire perimeter, those fuels will be left to burn on their own as that fuel is removed, its well within the black so theres not likely a chance it will spread beyond those predetermined or established boundaries. Story continues below advertisement Planned ignitions are continuing on the McDougall Creek wildfire to remove any unburnt fuels and bring the fire closer to containment lines. On September 9 crews conducted a small-scale planned ignition to remove unburnt fuel, there is no planned ignition today, September 10, said Evan Lizotte, Grouse Complex Fire Information Officer. Crews will remain on site to mop up any hot spots and secure containment lines.

Trudeau says G20 leaders condemnation of Russia not strong enough The above-average temperatures are forecast to stay for at least the next week. A ridge of high-pressure building in place over the weekend and temperatures into the upper 20s, were five degrees above the average for this time of year and it continues to be warm and sunny into early next week, said Global Meteorologist Yvonne Schalle. The BC Wildfire Service says billowing smoke can be a concern depending on where its burning. If you are seeing fire burning well within the perimeter so around black trees that are already burnt, thats typically not of concern but if you see fire start to increase in pockets of green beyond that fire perimeter its still beneficial to send those reports in, said Stearns. Since April there were a total of 192,185 hectares burned in the Kamloops Fire Centre compared to 2022 with 24,566 hectares burned. Advertisement
