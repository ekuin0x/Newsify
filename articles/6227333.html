                Prince Harry was said to be in his element as he showed off his 'experienced dad' side during an interaction with a young fan at the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf, Germany Prince Harry has been praised for his amazing interaction with a young fan during this year's Invictus Games. The Duke of Sussex, 38, was sat courtside beside Nigeria's Minister of Defence at the event in Dusseldorf, Germany, when a young fan of the UK approached him. Harry was more than happy to interact with the youngster, and a body language expert has explained how it shows the prince's "experienced dad" vibes and sensitive nature he takes from his mum Princess Diana. Judi James told the Mirror: "This is such a sweet moment as we can see Harry's face light up as the small child is brought over to chat, holding its cap over its face in a gesture of shyness. Harry is clearly so much in his element here, his body language state changes in an instant and he looks to at ease chatting playfully like the experienced dad that he is." For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . Judi continued: "It's in glimpses like this that we can see the DNA he inherited from his mother Diana, that very easy-going and natural, empathetic way of dealing with people, especially small children. Where Diana used signals of sympathy and affection Harry bonds via signals of humour and kindness but they share the instant reaction of bending fully to give small children their undivided attention." The moment comes after Harry is said to have "lowered his ego" as the games began on Saturday.
