                Oman has advocated for a global initiative focusing on nutritional development. This initiative seeks to moderate daily food intake, transform consumption habits, and boost food production efficiency. H E Dr Ahmed Nasser al Bakri, Undersecretary for Agriculture in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources, made the call at the International Conference on Food Security in Samarkand, Uzbekistan from September 7-8. The conference, a collaboration between the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), delved into the prevailing state of food production, challenges to eradicating hunger, and refining agricultural food systems. As a result, attendees committed to the ‘Samarkand Declaration on Food Security’. In his address, H E Bakri emphasised Oman’s dedication to fortifying its food security framework. This involves enhancing production of competitive goods, solidifying import supply chains, and strengthening logistics for storage and distribution across Oman. He added that the Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy 2040, along with the Fisheries Sector Strategy 2040, targets a more resilient agricultural and fishery sector in Oman. The goals include heightened economic returns, more job opportunities for Omanis, and bolstering rural communities. In recent years, the ministry has also initiated a food security investment laboratory. This lab zeroes in on short to medium-term investment projects, notably in the food and water security domain, carrying an investment value exceeding RO1.3bn. These projects align with Oman Vision 2040, as noted by H E Bakri. Furthermore, H E Bakri revealed that the Global Food Security Index 2022 placed Oman 35th globally, a leap from its 40th position in 2021. Impressively, in the Arab world, Oman climbed to 3rd in 2022 from its 5th place the previous year. The conference concluded by examining innovative global practices in food safety and quality.
