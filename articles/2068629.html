            <div id="content">
                U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert will probably try to spin her as a culture-war victory against the elitist liberals. The framing is easy: Those snobby stiffs in Denver dont know how to cut loose and have a good time if they cant tolerate someone having a little fun at a live performance described as . Oh, and clearly Boebert was targeted for being a Republican by patrons who complained about her behavior, right? But the true arc running through the many Boebert scandals  whether they are performative or genuine  is her astounding sense of entitlement. The tired trope of politicians throwing their titles around to excuse bad behavior is ironically true of Boebert, who took office claiming to be an outsider who was just an everyday Coloradan trying to raise her family in Gods Country. Boebert didnt care if she ruined the musical Beetlejuice playing at the Buell Theatre for anyone else, and she certainly didnt care if the pregnant woman sitting behind her had to breathe her second-hand smoke from a vape pen. Boebert denies that she was vaping, although she did admit to taking photos of the live performance. The woman sitting directly behind Boebert shared her story with The Post on the condition of anonymity out of fear that there would be backlash from the congresswoman and her supporters. She provided me with the receipt for her tickets and a photo from the event that shows Boebert seated in front of her. The woman described the evening as surreal. She didnt even recognize Boebert as Colorados congresswoman who represents the Western Slope and southern Colorado. These people in front of us were outrageous. Ive never seen anyone act like that before, the woman, who lives in Denver and is in her 30s, said. It wasnt until later during the play that someone informed her that the misbehaving theatergoer was, in fact, Boebert, a member of Congress. The woman says Boebert took multiple long videos during the first half of the performance. When she asked Boebert to stop vaping, the congresswoman simply said no, the woman said. Boebert was also kissing the man she was with, and singing along loudly with her hands in the air, the woman said. At intermission, I asked, Are there any other seats available? Can we sit somewhere else? the woman said. The usher said, Youre not the first complaint we had.  When the woman returned with her husband to their seats, she said Boebert called her a sad and miserable person. The guy she was with offered to buy me and my husband cocktails. Im pregnant! she said. But the behavior continued, with Boebert using her phone to record several segments of the second half of the show. The rest of the story is captured on surveillance video showing Boebert and an unidentified man getting ushered out of the Buell as the performance is going on. Boeberts staff issued a about the ordeal: I can confirm the stunning and salacious rumors: in her personal time, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert is indeed a supporter of the performing arts (gasp!) and, to the dismay of a select few, enthusiastically enjoyed a weekend performance of Beetlejuice.  A report from the staff of Denver Arts & Venues says three people complained at intermission and included this tidbit about what Boebert said as she left the building: stuff like do you know who I am, I am on the board (and) I will be contacting the mayor.  Boebert is not on the board of Denvers Center for the Performing Arts and if she were, I doubt she would support the DCPAs commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Im more than a little skeptical that Denvers new mayor would call in a favor for a family member acting so rudely at a play, let alone Boebert. Boeberts behavior is what voters would expect from a power-hungry politician, convinced that their own self-worth puts their needs and desires above others. Its a caricature, but hardly anyone from Congress behaves that way  even though theres ample evidence of some of vanity and conceit  because the public backlash is so great. Its a pattern of behavior from Boebert who doesnt seem to think rules and laws apply to her. Whether its in her now-closed restaurant in Rifle, , and other dramas unfolding with her family and friends in Garfield County, there is no question that Boebert, whose ex-husband made nearly a million dollars in two years as an oil and gas consultant before Boebert filed for divorce this year, considers herself beyond reproach. The pattern is so familiar that perhaps the most shocking part of this story is that Boebert supports the performing arts. As for the performance, our source tells me: It was so wonderful. I wish I would have been able to enjoy the first half as much
