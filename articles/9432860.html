Olga Calderon, 62, who now lives and works in Carluke, travelled from Chile less than two years after a brutal military coup d'tat led by dictator General Augusto Pinochet which started 50 years ago this week. Chiles President Salvador Allende, a democratic socialist, died at the presidential palace which was under attack.

Olgas father Leonidas Calderon was arrested while at work because of his political beliefs. He was one of tens of thousands of Chilean citizens herded into the Estadio Nacional football ground in Santiago. Thousands of those who were held were either executed or disappeared. Leonidas was tortured, and survived being sent to a concentration camp in the desert where he watched others die due to extreme heat and exhaustion. Olga's passport photo from 1975 (Image: UGC) He was transferred back to the football stadium where he was told he would be freed but ordered to leave the country. He didnt see his family for two years. Exiled in 1975, he arrived in Britain in June that year and was taken in temporarily by Neil and Mary McIntosh who lived in Hamilton, before moving to permanent accommodation in the Craigneuk area of Wishaw. Leonidas wife, also named Olga, was quite ill when she arrived not too long after with their children. Olga was just 14 years old at the time and was accompanied by her siblings, Maria, Jose, Philomena, Norma and Aladino. Another daughter, Senilda, remained in Chile. A family picture from 1997, front centre is Senilda who remained in Chile (Image: UGC) Leonidas and his son Jose found work in the slaughterhouse in Wishaw. Most of the family still live in the area now. Olga said: My sister was in love with a boy, he promised to look after her and asked permission from my father to marry her. So she stayed behind and they are still together to this day. My father always wanted to go back to Chile one day but he never did. He loved Scotland and loved the people, he was very friendly with everybody.

Theres been a lot of changes. My dad was a lorry driver and we lived on a fruit farm which exported fruit. That has been knocked down and there have been houses built." Lanarkshire couple Neil and Marys daughter, South Ayrshire Councillor Mary Donnelly, helped find a home for the Calderons in Craigneuk. Olga with her mum and siblings, Philomena, Norma and Dino (Image: UGC) Olga said: The community of Craigneuk opened their arms and welcomed us and made us feel part of their community, even though we could not speak a word of English. All the neighbours in Gateside Road were waiting for us on our arrival and they helped us adjust without even thinking about it. My father used to tell us to go and play, and say Thats the way you will learn the language.

Unfortunately most have passed away now. Leonidas died in December 1996 aged 65, while Olgas mum died in 2007, aged 70. Olgas family embraced life here and she attends Scotlands football matches whenever she can. She was at Hampden Park on Tuesday as they took on the Auld Enemy. Olga at the recent Scotland v England game (Image: UGC) She added: Scotland has become our home but we will never forget our home in Chile and the sacrifices my dad had to make in order to give us a better life. He never forgot where he came from and always remembered the kindness he was shown by the Scottish people. Olga has known Mary Donnelly since she arrived in 1975, and they still keep in touch. The family will always be grateful to Mary for her help and the oration she gave at Leonidass funeral.
