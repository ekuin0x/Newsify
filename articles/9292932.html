                Mayo, a former crane operator at Darwin Port Authority, has a background in unions before contributing to the creation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. Prominent Indigenous Voice campaigner Thomas Mayo has delivered a fiery speech to construction workers on why a Yes vote would be the best thing for Australia. Mayo, along with Aunty Violet Sheriden and MLA Rachel Stephen-Smith, spoke to workers at Canberra Hospital's expansion site on Wednesday in an event organised by the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU). The former crane operator at Darwin Port Authority has a background in unions, becoming the assistant national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) before contributing to the creation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. 'If we didn't have a voice we'd be exploited, we'd be ignored, we'd be degraded,' Mayo told the crowd. 'We wouldn't be able to further our interests and get better wages and conditions,' he said. 'We'd be f***ed right? If you don't have a voice you're f***ed.' 'That's what we're trying to do as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is to establish a voice where we can speak with some unity and coherency and affect the decisions that are made about us and get some progress. It is that simple.' 'Those same b*****ds that hate workers have been getting out there and spreading misinformation and lies (about the Voice),' Mayo added. 'This is the best thing that we can do for this country, to vote Yes,' he said, directing the crowd to the Yes23 website. Mayo was born on Larrakia country in Darwin, and grew up learning to hunt foods with his father and to island dance from the local Torres Strait Islander community of which he was a member. Speaking to the Judicial College of Victoria earlier this year, Mayo said he was a 'really quiet fella' who 'never expected to be doing what I'm doing'. He said he is motivated by a 'dislike of injustice', and learned most of what he knows 'about solidarity and acting collectively' during his near two decades on the wharf. 'My mum and dad weren't engaged in politics in any way,' he said. 'My Brett Lackey , By Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia
