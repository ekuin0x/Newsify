                This five-story Upper East Side townhouse, where the late, controversial film director Elia Kazan reportedly once lived, is currently on the market for $6.49 million  less than two months after the property transferred for $9 million, according to property records. (At the time, there was a $4.8 million mortgage on it.) The turn-of-the-century brownstone, at 212 E. 72nd St., between Second and Third avenues, comes with five bedrooms and 4 baths. Kazan  an immigrant born to Greek parents in Constantinople, now Istanbul, and the grandfather of actor Zoe Kazan  reportedly lived in the townhouse from around 1955 to the early 1960s. Representing the best and the worst of America, he once infamously named names to the House Un-American Activities Committee, destroying lives with his testimony, then took out a full-page ad in the New York Times encouraging others to follow his lead. In Naming Names, the late author/journalist Victor Navasky describes the time playwright Arthur Miller reportedly sent Kazan a copy of his play, A View from the Bridge, which deals with informing. Kazan wrote back his thanks, saying he would be honored to direct it. Miller shot back: You dont understand. I didnt send it to you because I wanted you to direct it. I sent it to you because I wanted you to know what I think of stool pigeons. Kazan went on to create iconic films like On the Waterfront and East of Eden. Of course, others in Hollywood refused to name names and some even managed to win Oscars while blacklisted, working under pseudonyms and keeping their integrity intact. At 5,242 square feet, the home features five fireplaces and five private outdoor spaces totaling 1,700 square feet, including a garden, two covered terraces and a roof deck. Theres also a coveted curb cut for private parking. The exterior features a stucco facade and three windows across. The 17-foot-wide townhouse is outside the Historic District and comes with a maximum buildable of 18,220 square feet. It currently includes a full-height cellar with a laundry room, storage and mechanical systems. The listing brokers are Leslie J. Garfields Matthew Lesser, Ravi Kantha, Jed Garfield and Caylyn Sullivan.
