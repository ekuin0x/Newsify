We have more newsletters Show Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Linda Nolan has heartbreakingly admitted that she knows she won't beat cancer a third time. The singer is currently battling the third resurgence of the disease in her liver. She underwent treatment in 2006 for breast cancer and in March she said on Good Morning Britain that she was "shocked and scared" after finding out the disease had spread to her brain. Writing in The Mirror, Linda penned: "You walk towards that consultants door and tell yourself 'Im OK'. Then you reach it and know youre really not. I took sister Anne with me on Monday for my scan results and we were both nervous. But this time, it was good news."

"Turns out, I was right. 'I can honestly say these scans are great,' said my lovely consultant. Those words. Few could sound sweeter. The relief rolled over me like a wave. Thank God. My tumours are stable and havent got any bigger. The chemo is keeping them at bay for now. So, we carry on. Every three weeks, for as long as I can tolerate it." "I went off to have my sixth cycle then. Its become a way of life now. I have my cancer book  a title I never thought Id have in my library  with all my bloods, weight and so on recorded (Ive lost 4kg, although I reckon I could live off whats left for some time)," Linda continued. "I know the nurses  theyre a great ear, they listen if you need to chat or are feeling low. And I people-watch, listen to the bleeps and the clapping when those finishing treatment ring the bell. Thats lovely, Im always happy for them, but I rang that bell twice. And I know now I wont be ringing it again." Linda has moved in with her sister Denise amid her health battle but admitted that she's "not giving up." Her sister Anne was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time three years ago and is now cancer-free, but their sister Bernie sadly died in 2013 after being diagnosed with breast cancer.
