                Fans of the beloved 90s film have been stunned to see photos of one of its child stars all grown up. Thirty years after the Tom Hanks-led film was released, viewers continue to fall in love with the adorable Jenny Curran who was played by actress Hanna Hall. The film was a massive hit, becoming one of Hanks most well-known movies and going on to win six Academy Awards in 1994, including Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Stream the world's best reality, entertainment and true crime shows for free on 7Bravo on The little girl Jenny in the film was best known for delivering the line Run, Forrest, Run in the flashback sequence from when Forrest (Hanks) was a boy. Hall, who was only 10 years old during filming, acted alongside fellow child star Michael Humphreys, who was eight. Now 39, Hall went on to act in films including Sofia Coppolas The Virgin Suicides, Happiness Runs, Halloween and Homecoming. The actress recently looked back on landing the film that started it all, revealing that being cast in Forrest Gump was very random. The child star, who grew up in Colorado, told that her manager had traded Los Angeles for Colorado because she was tired of Hollywood. She had a relationship with an agency that she would get represented by and she had an open casting call in the newspaper when I was seven years old, she said. My mother didnt want to take me. It was a Sunday afternoon and she really didnt want to go, so I went with some friends and (the casting agent) Nina ended up liking me. They called me back a couple of times and sent my tapes from Colorado to LA and they ended up casting me. Along with acting jobs here and there, Hall became an intimacy coordinator, in charge of facilitating scenes of a sexual nature to make sure actors feel comfortable and respected. While Hall added some other movie credits to her name, co-star and fellow child actor Humphries decided Hollywood wasnt for him. Im not sure I would have wanted to be a child star - it doesnt always seem to turn out well for a lot of them, he recently told . I reckon I am right, looking at some of them today. I dont think Hollywood is a healthy lifestyle for kids and you do not have a childhood or mature quickly. I was much better off going the route I did. Humphreys was offered numerous other roles, including The Brady Bunch film, but said his parents let him make up his own mind. He decided to continue with his education, sensing even back then that Hollywood wasnt all it was cracked up to be. Humphreys went on to enrol as an infantry soldier with the US Army, spending 18 months on a tour of duty in Iraq as well as time in Germany.
