                Japans Prime Minster Fumio Kishida attends the 18th East Asia Summit as part of the 43rd Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN Summit in Jakarta Indonesia Sept 7 EPAYonhap Japans prime minister said that Chinas blanket ban on Japanese seafood in reaction to the release of treated radioactive water from a tsunamiravaged nuclear power plant contrasts starkly with broad understanding shown by many other members of the international community The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japans northeastern coast started releasing treated and diluted radioactive wastewater in late August into the Pacific Ocean The release has been opposed by the Japanese fishing community which is worried about the reputation of the fish it catches China immediately banned all Japanese seafood Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Wednesday in Jakarta Indonesia after a session attended by leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as well as Korea and China that the treated water release is conducted under international safety standards and with the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency He said Japan has broadly gained understanding from the international community and that in sharp contrast Chinas blanket ban on Japanese seafood stuck out The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered major damage from a magnitude 90 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 2011 Kishida said he approached Chinese Premier Li Qiang during a break and explained to him Japans effort in the treated water discharge It was the first inperson highlevel contact between the two countries since the discharge began Aug 24 Kishida said he reiterated Japans scientific handling of the Fukushima Daiichi treated water release stressing the importance of a scientific approach and release of accurate information Kishida declined to comment on Lis response Chinese authorities as they imposed the seafood ban said they would dynamically adjust relevant regulatory measures as appropriate to prevent the risks of nuclearcontaminated water discharge to the health and food safety of our country Chinas Premier Li Qiang leaves after attending the East Asia Summit as part of the 43rd Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN Summit in Jakarta Sept 7 AFPYonhap China is the largest destination for Japanese seafood exports even though that is a small part of overall trade and Japanese exporters were hit hard by the ban Hours later in Japan US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was at the US Embassy in Tokyo where Ambassador Rahm Emanuel was serving vegetables and fruits from Fukushima and fish caught off the coast of neighboring Miyagi prefecture to support Japan I just view it as another way of the communist party of China putting the falsity out there trying to divide and its just an unfair position that they have and a false position that they have from the rest of the worlds stance said McCarthy criticizing Chinas ban on Japanese seafood McCarthy said he set up a bipartisan committee to study how China influences industries around the world when he became House Speaker and has seen China try to dominate and control a number of industries while dumping falsities on others and watching the same situation happen here So what you have to do is wake up to that day stand together stand with your friend do it based upon science as well something that China does not do McCarthy said noting Chinas lack of transparency during the COVID pandemic The US Embassy is also working with Japans government to find new export destinations in the United States as well as other countries for scallop processing that Japanese exporters used to conduct in China Japanese officials have said they plan to cultivate new export destinations in Taiwan the United States Europe the Middle East and some southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Singapore Kishidas Cabinet on Tuesday approved a 207 billion yen 141 million emergency fund to help exporters hit by Chinas ban on Japanese seafood The money will be used to find new markets for Japanese seafood to replace China and fund government purchases of seafood for temporary freezing and storage The government will also seek to expand domestic seafood consumption The new fund is in addition to the 80 billion yen 547 million that the government previously allocated to support fisheries and seafood processing and combat reputational damage on Japanese products AP
