                The Singaporean OTT streaming industry has received a major boost after two local actresses were nominated for the upcoming Asia Contents Awards & Global OTT (ACA & G.OTT) Awards. The nominations are for Best Leading Actress and Best Newcomer Actress for the hostage thriller series Third Rail (starring Rebecca Lim) and Sisters of the Night (starring Gini Chang). Both of these drama series were produced by Ochre Pictures, which won the accolade of Best Asian Drama Award for Last Madame (the precursor to Sisters of the Night ) at the same event three years ago. Rebecca Lim, one of Singapore's most well-regarded actresses, was nominated for Best Leading Actress for her intense role in Third Rail as Geri Hyak  a law-abiding, rule-following woman caught in a hostage crisis on a mass rapid transit train in urban Singapore. For the prize, she goes up against other acclaimed actresses including Song Hye-Kyo from South Korea, Karishma Tanna from India, Emily Chan from Malaysia, and Zoe Saldana from Hollywood. Third Rail was launched last year in Singapore and is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Newcomer Gini Chang is a contender for Best Newcomer Actress for her role in the Last Madame prequel, Sisters of the Night . She plays Nozomi, a young Japanese girl forced into prostitution in 1920s Singapore. Other nominees include rising stars in OTT content on Disney+, PCCW Thailand, Netflix, and China's Tencent. As it stands, these two films by Ochre Pictures are the only Singapore-produced content represented in the nominee line-up at the prestigious ACA & G.OTT Awards, which will be held in Busan on October 8, 2023. Ochre Pictures is so honored to be represented at this prestigious global awards, and for our actors to be nominated alongside world-class professionals from all around the world," said Jean Yeo, Executive Producer and Creative Director at Ochre Picutres. "Whether we win or not, these nominations are validations that Singaporean content producers can punch above our weight, and stand shoulder to shoulder with the biggest global players.
