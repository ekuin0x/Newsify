                This endless week of crumbling schools, poor public services and collapsing council finances has been 13 years in the making  and even loyal Tories now know the game is up It is now a year since the short, disastrous premiership of Liz Truss. But when Rishi Sunak entered the House of Commons on Wednesday, politics at Westminster seemed just as disconnected from reality as during her chaotic 50-day tenure inside No 10. Tory backbenchers and ministers greeted Sunak, after their long summer break, with customary roars as he took his seat for prime minister's questions. The more difficulty their leader is in these days, the more noise they seem to make. Quite why they were in such good voices must have been a mystery to any objective onlooker. In the week when pupils returned to class for the new school year, the government had just shamefacedly published a list of 147 state schools in England whose buildings were in danger of collapsing (having previously refused to name those affected). Many of the schools are in Tory constituencies. Classrooms, assembly halls, dining rooms and corridors were cordoned off before term began, and returning children found themselves shunted into temporary "safe spaces", wherever these could be found. George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor and architect of austerity, used to accuse his Labour predecessors of "failing to mend the roof while the sun was shining". But after 13 years of the cost-cutting he initiated, much of the school estate is in danger of total collapse. Former civil servants said the fault lay with politicians who wanted to save money rather than pay for repairs. As policy disasters go, it was up there with the worst. Few Conservative MPs see much hope. Poll ratings have not shown any sign of improving, despite endless initiatives aimed at shifting the dial Other stories last week added to the impression of national malaise. Hours before the list of crumbling schools was made public, terror suspect Daniel Khalife had gone on the run, having escaped from Wandsworth prison on the underside of a delivery van. Staff shortages and cuts to prison budgets were blamed. Questions were Toby Helm , Anna Fazackerley , David Barnett
