                A former teen beauty queen is claiming she was raped and forced into the sordid world of porn in a new bombshell lawsuit against sexxx-rated giant Pornhub. Kristy Althaus  who was runner-up in the 2013 Miss Teen Colorado pageant  is also suing Pornhubs parent company, MindGeek, now known as Aylo. Althaus saw her pageant crown ripped from her after a leaked sex video from GirlsDoPorn.com was leaked to organizers. Threatened, coerced, and physically and sexually assaulted, plaintiff was forced to succumb to the demands of the GirlsDoPorn sex-trafficking venture, entirely sustained by MindGeeks vast online network, the federal lawsuit filed on Sept. 8 states, according to the New York Post . The site was run by one-time FBI Most Wanted fugitive Michael James Pratt. According to Althaus lawsuit, after her pageant triumph, she pursued modelling work and answered a Craigslist ad. GirlsDoPorn flew the then-18-year-old to San Diego for a photoshoot. Rather than the mere headshots and clothing photoshoot (sic) that she had agreed to fly to San Diego to do, Pratt began demanding that plaintiff film nude and sexually explicit videos, the lawsuit states. When plaintiff refused, Pratt, now 41, and his conspirators immediately pressured her and plied her with booze and pills to soften her reluctance. Pratt also allegedly took the young womans cellphone during filming. According to the Post, Pratts GirlsDoPorn co-conspirator, Michael Isaac Wolfe, has admitted to coercing around 100 models (aged 18 to 23) into making porn. They allegedly told the women the clips would not be shown in the U.S. The feds shuttered the site in 2019. In addition, Wolfe revealed that Pratt also ran a website called Pornwikileaks that published identifying information about the true identities of many starlets. The result was humiliation and severe harassment. Althaus said the duo and two other men were present for filming her in a southern California hotel room. The onetime pageant queen claimed she was in fear for her life. Unfortunately, GirlsDoPorn had posted the first video of plaintiff on MindGeeks network, and the video became wildly successful. MindGeek and GirlsDoPorn generated millions of dollars from plaintiffs video, the complaint states. The pornographers promoted the video by referring to the unwilling star as Miss Teen Colorado. The Canadian-owned company told Fox News in a statement that safety is its No. 1 priority. Out of respect for the integrity of court proceedings, our policy is not to comment on ongoing litigation. We look forward to the facts being fully and fairly aired in that forum, Aylo said in a release. But even after Althaus appeared in the video and had begun her first year of college, Pratt allegedly blackmailed and threatened the young woman into filming more porn. He allegedly threatened her with a gun and made her perform oral sex on him. Despite its actual or constructive knowledge that GirlsDoPorn used force, fraud and coercion to film young women in pornographic videos, MindGeek continued to offer its global platform, internet distribution channels, and financial lifeline to the GirlsDoPorn criminal enterprise for over a decade, Althaus lawsuit states. The women had been promised $3,000 to $5,000 for a one-day shoot. [GirlsDoPorn even] went so far as to hire actresses to pose as previous models and assure new recruits of their privacy and security, the lawsuit said. Since she was outed, Althaus claims she cant hold a job and her love life has been a train wreck. Pratt was finally run to ground last year in Spain by the U.S. Marshals after years on the lam. bhunter@postmedia.com @HunterTOSun
