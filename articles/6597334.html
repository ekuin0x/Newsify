One remains in a serious condition and the other has non-life-threatening injuries. The violent incident happened just metres from a mother and her young children sitting in the food court. Police have said the two groups of men were not believed to be known to each other. After the alleged stabbings, a 19-year-old Springvale man, a 17-year-old Mill Park teen and an 18-year-old Narre Warren man were arrested two streets away. They are assisting police with their inquiries and anyone with information is urged to contact police.
