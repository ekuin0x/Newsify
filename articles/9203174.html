                Todd Cantwell will MISS up to four games in a major blow to Rangers. The star injured his knee towards the end of the derby defeat to s and before the international break and will now spend a period on the sidelines as he recovers from the issue. will also miss up to four weeks still as he starts his return to fitness. He's now back jogging but is still a while away yet. The positive news is Tom Lawrence is available for selection after returning to full fitness while is in a 'really good place' with both men suffering extended injury periods last season. Being able to call on both players will be massive for the Rangers boss who has vowed to play his strongest team against as he bids to pick up a vital victory with the pressure on after the results before the international break leaving the Light Blues four points behind Celtic after just four games. He told the media: "The strongest team will play the next game, Tom Lawrence is now fully fit, [Kemar] Roofe is in a really good place. "Unfortunately, Todd Cantwell will miss the next three or four games, and [Kieran] Dowell will also miss out. "Todd was a an issue with his knee in a challenge towards the end of the game. He should be returning in three to four weeks. Kieran is now back jogging and should be three to four weeks away also." Rangers have big games on the horizon with the ampaign getting underway at Ibrox under the lights next week against Real Betis while Livingston also arrive in Govan later this month for the quarter-final with the winner advancing to the last four and booking a day out at Hampden.
