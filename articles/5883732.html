                Families are being chased for unpaid school dinner bills by Glasgow debt collectors. Renfrewshire Council has employed a firm to pursue parents who owe them money for children's lunches, sparking fury from anti-poverty campaigners. A Freedom of Information request names Sheriff Officer firm Walker Love as the firm used by the authority. The company has a team of 32 staff working across Scotland and have contracts with the private and public sector to chase a range of debts, the reports. Sheriff's Officers are officers of the court in Scotland who are employed by private firms or are self-employed and take instructions to enforce court orders. They have the power to evict people, make them pay a debt, seize property and even detain members of a household. It is unclear what enforcement action has been taken in relation to school meal debts. Labour's Monica Lennon MSP condemned the move, she said: "It's shameful that hungry children and struggling families are being hounded over school meal debts and living in fear of Sheriff Officers banging on their door. "Humza Yousaf must get a grip and stop the debt collectors in their tracks. We need an immediate moratorium on school meal debt and an emergency Cabinet meeting to thrash out a new delivery plan for universal free school meals for primary 6 and 7 pupils and the secondary school pilot scheme that is long overdue." SNP-run Renfrewshire Council includes some of Scotland's poorest communities with 56 zones identified as having levels of deprivation among the worst in the country, including a number in Ferguslie Park. The gap between minimum and maximum male life expectancy in Renfrewshire is 15 years. Ms Lennon added: "Humza Yousaf's hollow words will not fill empty bellies or feed young minds. "Ending child hunger and binning the stigma associated with means tested free school meals must be a genuine priority for the SNP-Scottish Green government. "They claim to be fair and progressive but the failure to keep promises to Scotland's children is resulting in cruel and unjust practices. "The SNP used to believe that Scotland should be the best country in the world for children to grow up in. "Every single day teachers, school canteen workers, social workers, charities and churches are stepping up to help those in need. "Research undertaken by my office has exposed the consequences of SNP broken promises and complacency, and it's children who are paying the price. "It doesn't need to be like this. Political leaders choose their priorities, and thankfully Sadiq Khan in London and Labour in Inverclyde have shown that universal free school meals can be delivered on time and within budget." Asked why they were targeting parents with debt collectors, a spokesperson for the council said: "We work with parents and carers to try and resolve school meal debt as early as possible. "Our schools contact parents and carers to remind them of any payments due and offer support and signpost to advice services where appropriate. "Where debt is not resolved, the council will try and recover the debt through its normal processes. "We are reviewing how we manage school meal debt to ensure that families get the support they need. This includes improving the efficiency of the processes involved and identifying options for writing off debt for the most vulnerable families." The council insisted it was working to identify low income families struggling financially in order to offer increased support and claimed 400 households were recently identified as needing extra help. While many of Scotland's councils claimed not to hold information on school meal debt levels and actions to pursue parents, Dundee City Council admitted to having sent out 15669 letters in 2022/23. A spokesperson said: "We have created supports for families and no child is ever denied their school meal." Last year it emerged an anonymous donor bailed out parents struggled to pay for their children's school meals. Aberlour Children's Charity received a "significant five figure sum" after publishing a report about the 1million debt owed by parents across Scotland's 32 local authorities for unpaid school meal payments. The cash was given to several councils to help them clear the debt with Aberdeen City Council confirming it was one of the recipients. Aberlour chief executive Sally Ann Kelly wrote an open letter to all local authorities urging them all to wipe their school meal debts and arguing the Scottish Government could do more. She said: "We are appealing directly to you as council leaders across Scotland to do everything you can to help families on the lowest incomes. "We continue to call on Scottish Government to maximise eligibility for free school meals for low income working families with immediate effect." Roz Foyer, STUC general secretary has led calls for universal free school meal provision. She said: "The Scottish Government should immediately wipe these debts and make school meals universally free. That would make a huge difference to so many families." Currently all primary one to five children receive a meal at school, however a Scottish Government promise to extend the policy to all primary aged children has been delayed and will not be delivered until 2026. A vow to hold a pilot project to deliver meals in secondary schools is also yet to materialise. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan last week called on Humza Yousaf to "step up" on his primary school meal commitments. Khan rolled out his 135million plan for children in the UK capital last week. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: "Earlier this year COSLA published a set of good practice principles for the management of school meal debt. "These principles have been developed by COSLA, working with partners from across local government, and can be considered by councils when making decisions on local policy and practice. "Councils have the power to make discretionary offers of free school meals to families experiencing financial hardship due to exceptional circumstances, who do not meet the regular eligibility criteria."
