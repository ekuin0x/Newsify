He will now be sticking with until January at least. The Sheffield-born man came off the bench in their 3-1 defeat against Arsenal last time out at the Emirates Stadium.

It is crazy but how it works. Harry has to block this. You see his career, (he has) a lot to come, he has to block it by good performances. When asked how he will manage Maguire now, the manager said: It is about team construction, the group dynamic and always about the team, that is above everything else but within that everyone plays his role, different characters and you have to manage those characters. play Brighton and Hove Albion this weekend as they look to return to winning ways. The Red Devils have picked up six points so far this term.
