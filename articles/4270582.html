                On Thursday former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro joined a very long list consisting of hundreds of people who have been convicted of crimes due to their loyalty to the onetime host of Celebrity Apprentice Reacting to this news former President Donald Trump on Friday posted an angry incoherent rant on his Truth Social account that accused the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th Capitol riots of framing his political ally I cant believe that these Fascist Monsters have so viciously gone after the great Peter Navarro for defying the totally partisan January 6th Unselect Committee of political Hacks and Thugs who refused to go after Crazy Nancy Pelosi and the reasons she and the Mayor of DC REJECTED 10000 soldiers which would have easily stopped any future security problem Trump wrote His testimony wouldnt have mattered anyway because the Committee QUICKLY and ILLEGALLY DELETED  DESTROYED ALL EVIDENCE  FINDINGS POLL Should Trump be allowed to run for office  Trumps post is filled with factual inaccuracies as Nancy Pelosi never blocked any National Guard troops from going to the Capitol on January 6th and all of the Jan 6 Committees evidence and interview transcripts can be found on its website Whats more Trumps assertion that Navarro defied the committee is in itself incriminating given that it is illegal to defy a lawful subpoena from the United States Congress Spanish state prosecutors have accused Luis Rubiales of sexual assault and coercion for kissing a player on the lips without her consent after the Womens World Cup final the countrys prosecutors office said Friday Rubiales the nowsuspended president of the Spanish soccer federation kissed Jenni Hermoso on the lips during the awards ceremony after Spain beat England to win the title on Aug 20 in Sydney Australia Prosecutors presented a case against Rubiales to Spains National Court in Madrid two days after Hermoso formally accused him of sexual assault  According to a sexual consent law passed last year Rubiales could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty of sexual assault The new law eliminated the difference between sexual harassment and sexual assault sanctioning any unconsented sexual act Prosecutors added Friday that Rubiales could have committed an act of coercion when according to Hermoso he pressured her to speak out in his defense immediately after the scandal erupted regarding his behavior Rubiales has insisted the kiss was consensual Hermoso has denied that in statements issued by her and her players union Prosecutors have asked the judge that Rubiales appear before a court to give preliminary testimony If the National Court judge agrees the hear the case it would lead to a formal court investigation that will end with a recommendation for the case to either be dismissed or go to trial Hermoso a 33yearold forward now plays for Mexican club Pachuca after a long career with top Spanish and European clubs including Barcelona Paris SaintGermain and Atletico Madrid She returned to her Mexican club on Thursday The 46yearold Rubiales faces threats other than a possible criminal trial He was suspended from his post by FIFA on Aug 27  a day after he refused to step down when he delivered a defiant speech to the general assembly of his federation in which he said he was victim of a witch hunt by false feminists Rubiales was banned from his post for 90 days while FIFA disciplinary judges consider his case Soccers governing body can impose sanctions on individuals ranging from warnings and fines to suspensions from the sport Rubiales also faces action from the Spanish government A government legal panel overseeing sports has opened a probe to determine if he abused his authority by kissing Hermoso or tainted the image of Spain with his conduct He faces being deemed unfit to hold his post for up to two years Rubiales behavior at the final which included a lewd crotch grab while next to dignitaries including Spains queen and teenage princess combined with his controversial speech have tarnished the Womens World Cup title and damaged his own federation Spains womens players have said they wont play again for their nation until big changes are made in the federation The federation fired coach Jorge Vilda but the players have yet to say if they consider that sufficient The accusation by prosecutors against Rubiales came as the players for Spains womens league began their strike on the opening day of the competition after salary talks with the league broke down The league called Liga F was one of the first soccer institutions to criticize Rubiales conduct Rubiales a former player and former head of Spains biggest players union has run the federation since 2018 He has boosted revenues and funding for lowerlevel soccer and the womens game but his successes have normally been tinged with scandal Rubiales revolutionized the Spanish Super Cup in 2019 by taking it to Saudi Arabia  now the big draw for top European talent like Cristiano Ronaldo  in exchange for 40 million a year The move was criticized by womens and human rights groups for the regimes treatment of women and minorities Spanish authorities also scrutinized the deal and an investigative judge is probing the legality of the Super Cup contracts Rubiales increased his power by becoming a vice president of European soccer body UEFA  and was supposed to lead the bid by Spain Portugal and Morocco to host the 2030 mens World Cup Spains government has since warned that the bid to host one of the worlds biggest sporting events is at risk of being sullied AP CONTINUE READING Show less Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger could block Donald Trump from his states ballot according to a new analysis but hes simply choosing not to do so The states top election official published a Wall Street Journal oped on Wednesday stating that he cant keep Trump off the ballot but MSNBC columnist Hayes Brown argued that Georgia law gives Raffensperger both the power and the responsibility to remove the former president as a primary candidate Despite that headline the Republicans piece is more about how he shouldnt block Trump and less about whether he could  Brown wrote By arguing that he shouldnt and cant Raffenspergers wrong on both fronts Under Georgia law he doesnt just have the power to keep Trump off the ballot  he has the responsibility to do so POLL Should Trump be allowed to run for office  He cites attempts to block Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene RGA and former Rep Madison Cawthorn RNC from the 2022 ballot saying both challenges failed but Brown said a federal appeals court found after he lost his primary that Cawthorn could have been barred from office while an administrative law judge found that Greenes proinsurrection sentiments were expressed before she had sworn her oath of office so Raffensperger kept her on the ballot But a look at Georgia election law shows it didnt have to be that way Brown wrote Crucially the law states that candidates who have been named by Georgia political parties or who have submitted their names for candidacy shall meet the constitutional and statutory qualifications for holding the office being sought That clearly includes the provisions of the disqualification clause which was rightly considered the supreme law of the land in the federal courts Greene decision The question then is whether Raffensperger wants to act in the best interests of his constituents Brown added Georgias voters entrusted him with that power and no matter how much he tries to hand that power back the law recognizes that power as his CONTINUE READING Show less At the conclusion of an MSNBC  Morning Joe segment inspired by a column by the New York Times Charles Blow cohost Mike Brzezinski went on a tirade about voters who still refuse to abandon stupid Donald Trump  To make her point about the former presidents mental limitations Brzezinski brought up the former presidents loss in a defamation trial filed by writer E Jean Carroll that cost him 5 million in damages Despite that the former president defamed her immediately after his court loss again which has now led him to the brink of having to pay additional millions after a judges ruling this past week  POLL Should Trump be allowed to run for office As Brzezinski told the panel Democrats have a wealth of material to use to attack Trump that go beyond the theft of nuclear secrets that led to a Department of Justice indictment in Florida I mean okay nuclear secrets as cohost Joe Scarborough brought up or stealing election if thats too boring for you if youre desensitized to that she exclaimed How about would you really vote for a guy who is stupid enough first of all to get sued for defamation and sexual abuse to be found liable on both of those charges and then be stupid enough to defame E Jean Carroll again and to keep losing in court to her She then advised Democrats Maybe take a note from E Jean Carroll and keep coming back at him and calling him out for his vicious disgusting behavior Well Mika Scarborough interjected also not just the stupidity but  So stupid the disgusted Brzezinski interrupted Watch the video below or at this link  MSNBC 09 08 2023 07 27 30 youtube CONTINUE READING Show less
