                Banning textbook bans in California is the goal of a bill now headed to the governors desk In mainly partyline votes the Democraticcontrolled state legislature on Thursday Sept 7 passed  legislation seen as Sacramentos counterstrike against conservative school boards that keep certain textbooks and related materials out of the classroom In most cases the boards say theyre protecting children from pornography and other harmful content Critics contend theyre trying to erase any mention of people or truthful lessons about the role of race in US history A textbook showdown occurred earlier this year in Temecula where the school board with supplemental materials that referenced the late LGBTQ civil rights leader Harvey Milk Two board members called Milk a pedophile threatened and fine the Temecula Valley Unified School District if the board did not approve the curriculum The Temecula school board  Sponsored by Assemblymember Corey Jackson DPerris AB 1078 would require school boards to approve materials that accurately portray the contributions of people of all genders and the role and contributions of Latino Americans LGBTQ Americans and other ethnic cultural religious and socioeconomic status groups School boards defying the mandate would risk losing state funding AB 1078 would apply to school library materials as well The bill would also let the state buy textbooks for school districts that dont comply with the cost coming out of those districts share of state money Newsom a Democrat is expected to sign the bill California is the true freedom state a place where families  not political fanatics  have the freedom to decide whats right for them the governor said in a news release issued by Jacksons office With the passage of this legislation that bans book bans and ensures all students have textbooks our states Family Agenda is now even stronger All students deserve the freedom to read and learn about the truth the world and themselves Related Articles The release also quoted Jackson who is Black as saying Were taking a firm stand against book banning in Californias schools ensuring that our students have access to a broad range of educational materials that accurately represent the rich cultural and racial diversity of our society Conservatives oppose AB 1078 calling it an attack on parents rights and local control of public education hearing in August to fight the bill Its extremely frustrating to see this bill before us which would not only make it harder for school boards to do their job but it would silence the voices of parents and community members that are rightfully upset Assemblymember Kate Sanchez a Republican representing parts of Orange and Riverside counties  The California School Boards Association also opposes AB 1078 calling it draconian and duplicative because existing state law already accomplishes the bills goals AB 1078 would cause confusion and unintended consequences the association was quoted as saying in a legislative analysis of the bill AB 1078 passed the Assembly by a 6117 vote and the Senate by a 319 vote
