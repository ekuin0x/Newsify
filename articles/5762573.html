                Weve teamed up with Empire State Bastard, the extreme metal supergroup featuring s Simon Neil, for a limited-edition bundle featuring an exclusive hand-signed lyric sheet and a patch  and only 300 are available. This exclusive Empire State Bastard x Metal Hammer bundle comes with a lyric sheet for the song signed by frontman Simon Neil and guitarist Mike Vennart, plus a logo patch. The magazine itself also features a special magazine cover shot at Glasgows Cathouse, where Empire State Bastard played their first show. Inside, Simon Neil and co-conspirator Mike Vennart (Biffy Clyro session guitarist, ex-Oceansize) explain the story behind the band, which also features drumming legend Dave Lombardo and bassist Naomi Macleod of Dublin post-punk-influenced trio Bitch Falcon. I had this song by [US proto-grindcore band] Siege in my head, thats just a punishing, fucking abrasive noise, says Mike. I made a note on my phone that said, Make an album. Make all the songs sound like by Siege. Just make a punishing, fast, horrible album.' Debut Empire State Bastard album is a mash-up of grindcore, hardcore, drone metal, art metal, doomy post-punk and more. Any metal album can be made on a fucking laptop, says Simon Neil. But the best heavy music, the best extreme metal, has feel, it has soul. Lifes too short to listen to that fucking CGI metal shit. There are only 300 of these Empire State Bastard x Metal Hammer bundles available worldwide  and theyre only available online.
