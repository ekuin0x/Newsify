                Shop owners and residents are not taking kindly to 'flash crowds' who come to pose and eat fast food in the city's quaint tangle of streets such as De 9 Straatjes It is 3<br>- 30pm on a Friday and 28-year-old German Lisa Wulff is in a half-hour queue for bubble tea and "toasts" at Amsterdam's Chun cafe<br>-  "I've seen it on social media, and it looks good," she says<br>-  "My generation is more on Instagram, but I have a younger sister, so I saw it on TikTok<br>- " She is one of 23 million overnight tourists expected this year in Amsterdam and is looking to eat in the city's famous De 9 Straatjes  "nine little streets"<br>-  One brick road down, the queue for posh chip shop and fellow social media sensation Fabel Friet stretches across a bridge<br>-  They are symptoms of a certain kind of tourism, inspired more by social media than classic attractions or guidebooks, also seen in Italy and Spain, but very evident in this small, heavily visited country<br>-  While the number of tourists appears to be back at peak 2019 levels, Amsterdammers complain that many appear more inspired by Instagrammable food, lazy bike rides and "window shopping" in the red light district than by the city's top hotels, museums and galleries<br>-  Some are particularly concerned about social media-influenced flash crowds in places used to a meandering stream<br>-  Outside Fabel Friet, a notice asks customers "kindly to respect our neighbours by not eating your fries in front of their houses" while Brenned Tieman on security duty asks tourists to move to the canal to eat their fries with "war" sauce (mayo, satay and onions)<br>-  Although Fabel Friet started promoting itself during the pandemic with viral TikTok clips handcutting chips or magically forming them into the shop's name, co-founder Floris Feilzer would prefer a Michelin star to social media fame<br>-  "We are done with the TikTok label," he says<br>-  "If you don't have the quality, it won't come to anything<br>-  It's about having great products, and a heart for the business and for the neighbourhood<br>-  A lot of residents come here for chips<br>- " At Chun Senay Boztas
