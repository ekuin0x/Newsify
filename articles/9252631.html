                Ex-Liverpool defender Glen Johnson believes money was a "major factor" in his former team-mate Jordan Henderson moving to Saudi Arabia - and wouldn't be surprised if Mohamed Salah followed in January. prompted a major shock this summer who are managed by his predecessor as Reds captain, The England international has since claimed he was persuaded to make the transfer and dismissed suggestions he only moved due to a significantly-increased salary. But said: Bloody hell, of course the money was a major factor. Hes not gone there for the standard of football and if it wasnt about money, then he would have gone somewhere else. "James Milner moved to Brighton at 37 years of age, so there would have been many clubs that would have wanted Jordan this summer in Europe. However, Al-Ettifaq wanted him and paid him an absolute fortune so you cant blame him for going, but I do believe that money was a huge, huge motivator. resisted overtures for Salah from the same club However, Johnson believes the Reds will find it difficult to do likewise should the Saudi Pro League come calling again with a massive offer in the January transfer window. I could see it happening," he said. "Mos not going to be able to always perform at the same levels that he has been doing over the past few years and if Liverpool can cash in for huge money for a 31-year-old, then it would be difficult for the club to turn down. "The same goes for Mo because he will find it difficult to turn down the money thats on offer for him. January could be the perfect time for Liverpool to cash in because if Mos interested in the move then they can make an enormous amount of money for a player thats in his thirties.
