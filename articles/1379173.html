                Horoscope today: Daily guide to what the stars have in store for YOU - September 11, 2023 By Oscar Cainer For The Daily Mail Published: 23:54 BST, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 00:31 BST, 11 September 2023 e-mail View comments After the weekend's Mars-Uranus link there's a sense of frustration in the air. But it's not the kind of ineffective fury that causes problems. When directed in positive ways anger is a useful tool. Today, we can initiate positive change. Even in situations that seem stuck, with a different mindset, impressive shifts are possible. Actions started today can be transformative. ARIES March 21 - April 20 We make generalisations about people's character. And we assume their qualities and peculiarities will stay with them forever. Yet experience alters everyone's approach and attitude. It changes the way we respond to life's challenges and delights. The older you get, the wiser you get. And the more your ability to be successful increases. If things don't go according to plan today, don't lose sight of the fact that you're on a journey. Hiccups are inevitable. But they bring insights that will help you find contentment. The New Moon suggests good times are on the way. To find out more visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope Oscar says even in situations that seem stuck, with a different mindset, impressive shifts are possible. Actions started today can be transformative TAURUS April 21 - May 21 You're feeling restricted. It's as if the walls are closing in and the light coming through the windows is diminishing. Everything feels a bit gloomy. But the cell you seem stuck in only exists in your mind. It's the product of your imagination. I'm not negating the obstacles you face. Yes various limitations are impacting your plans. But when you assess your situation with courage and honesty, you'll find a way to free yourself from a tiresome obligation. Give yourself permission to do that. It will be replaced by a liberating opportunity. Discover why this week's New Moon is so magical for you. Visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope GEMINI May 22 - June 22 It's entirely appropriate for you to be feeling excited and enthusiastic. Your situation really does have the potential to transform for the better. And if you can't yet see a reason to be optimistic, the coming days bring news that will fuel the fire of hope in your heart. You're entitled to a better, easier, happier lifestyle than the one you've been leading. Although you can't wave a wand and change everything in a flash, you can begin to take a series of very positive steps that can only lead in the right direction. Don't hesitate. The New Moon brings the key to the future you dream of. For info you need, visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope CANCER June 23 - July 23 Historians are like detectives. The knowledge they gain from working out how and why events occurred, has, throughout history, helped advise rulers and governments. And we're all historians of our own pasts. We learn from previous relationships and experiences, and apply that knowledge to our current situations. Everything you know is shaped by what you've lived. You might think you face a new kind of challenge. But it's a familiar problem that's presenting itself in disguise. You know exactly how to deal with it. Maximise the New Moon energy! For your latest forecasts visit: www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope LEO July 24 - August 23 'No man (or woman) is an island'. Our lives our entwined in many ways: some of them obvious, others more mysterious. With Venus continuing its journey through your sign, you're more conscious of the bonds that link you to other people. You're realising why a course of action is no good if it negatively impacts someone else. And that when you're sensitive, you create a better environment for everyone. This increased awareness brings bonuses too. Here comes a generous offer of support from an unexpected source. The New Moon brings positive change! Find out more! Visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope VIRGO August 24 - September 23 You know the fairytale. The princess was so sensitive that she detected a pea hidden under a huge pile of mattresses. And so she passed the test to prove her royal lineage. Nowadays of course, that kind of extreme sensitivity would be treated either as a medical condition or as a symptom of extreme diva-like characteristics! There are different ways of looking at the way you're coping with a situation. Either you're paying too much attention to a detail. Or you're feeling hypersensitive. You can change your approach today. The New Moon can transform your world. For valuable keys to the week visit: www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope LIBRA September 24 - October 23 The words peace and love fit together so well that we don't bother to question the connection between them. Yet they're not the same thing. If we lock ourselves away from the world, we might find peace (but will there be much love around?). And we can love with a fierce passion that's anything but peaceful. Just because your ruler, Venus, is moving through fiery Leo doesn't mean you have to choose between peace and love. But you'll get along more easily with your current circumstances if you remember the difference. Be ready for a special time! The New Moon brings exciting opportunities. Visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope SCORPIO October 24 - November 22 Every language has its own peculiar, untranslatable expressions. Try explaining 'it's raining cats and dogs' to someone who's learning English! Or 'cutting off your nose to spite your face'. Cartoonists might depict this metaphor by drawing a gardener, sitting halfway up a tree, brandishing a saw, trying to cut the branch they're actually sitting on! Not that I'm suggesting you'd do anything as ridiculous as that. Making silly mistakes isn't your style. But if you take time to think before you act today, you'll save a lot of time and energy. The New Moon highlights dynamic changes. Your future has huge potential. Visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope After the weekend's Mars-Uranus (pictured) link there's a sense of frustration in the air. But it's not the kind of ineffective fury that causes problems SAGITTARIUS November 23 - December 21 You're about to be let off the hook. Phew. As a complicated drama sorts itself out, you've got space to focus on what you want to deal with (rather than what you've got to deal with). Until, that is, the cosmos throws another curve ball in your direction! Still a change is as good as a rest. And being a Sagittarian, you see life's inevitable problems as challenges  which you rise to with style. Right now though, you can move forwards enjoying a sense of freedom. Things are starting to move in the right direction. Just go with the flow! Wonderful opportunities arise as the New Moon energises your life. Visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope CAPRICORN December 22 - January 20 We love murder mysteries. There's always a new series to watch, or a best-seller to read. We enjoy trying to figure out the clues and spot the red herrings. We think we've identified the culprit, but we have to wait to see if we've guessed right. And there's always a twist in the tale. In real life too, we can jump to the wrong conclusion. It's easy to take evidence at face value. We think we know all there is to know (when only half the story has been told). Make sure you've investigated all the possibilities before making a decision today. This week brings a powerful New Moon. To create the change you wish for visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope AQUARIUS January 21 - February 19 When is a mistake not a mistake? When you realise that you mistakenly thought you'd made a mistake! Everything happens for a reason. We might not know why something's 'going wrong' but we can be confident that, on some level, it's going wrong for the right reasons. It's much better to look for positives than linger on negatives. Just because something's taking longer than you'd like, doesn't mean it's not going well. The legacy of your ruler's link with dynamic Mars enables you to see a frustrating situation in a new light. How will the New Moon transform your life? There's inspiring news when you visit www.cainer.com/daily-horoscope PISCES February 20 - March 20 You've got a decision to make. The good news, is that it doesn't really matter what you decide - just so long as you make some kind of choice. Picture yourself as an adventurer in a tropical forest. Your current path leads to a swamp. On your left, there's a vine. If you swing on it, you'll avoid the mud. Alternatively, if you climb the tree to your right, you'll access a rope bridge that goes right over the top and takes you to firm ground. Either option will work. But if you just keep on walking, you know where you'll end up! The New Moon brings powerful positive change!
