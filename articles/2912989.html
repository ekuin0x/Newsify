Popular: Netflix viewers are hooked to the streaming services latest true crime thriller, Burning Body Drama: Released last week, the series is inspired by true events and is set in Barcelona, Spain Directed by Feroz Award nominee Jorge Torregrossa (Intimacy, La Vida Inesperada), Burning Body is based on a true story and stars Money Heist's rsula Corber, Feroz and Gaud nominee Quim Gutirrez, and Feroz and Goya Award winner Eva Llorach. The true story is referred to as 'el Crimen de la Guardia Urbana,' or the crime of the Urban Guard, which caused a media frenzy in Spain beginning in 2017. The story revolves around the 2017 murder of Guardia officer Pedro Rodrguez and the 2020 trial involving Rodrguez's partner, Rosa Peral, and her lover at the time, Albert Lpez. Both were Rodrguez's fellow officers. The series, which debuted on 8 September, has been lauded as 'phenomenal' and has left viewers 'unable to stop watching'. Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, one wrote: Just watched the first episode of Burning Body on Netflix and I'm already hooked.' Another said: 'Burning Body on Netflix is so darn good. Each episode is better than the next. Absolutely phenomenal!' 'This show is so good', a third viewer wrote. A fourth said: 'If you're a fan of true crime, do yourself a favour and start watching Burning Body on Netflix... and thank me later!'. The synopsis from Netflix reads: 'Upon the finding of a burned body in the Foix reservoir near Barcelona, the plot delves into the tangle of toxic relationships, cheating, violence and sex scandals involving the deceased (Pedro, a cop) and another two fellow agents (Rosa and Albert)' The series was entirely shot in the Province of Barcelona, Spain, where the real murder case that inspired the show took place in 2017. Filming commenced in September 2022 and wrapped up in February of the following year.
