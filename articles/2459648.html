                Forbes Lifestyle ForbesLife An E-Scooter With Safety In Mind Scott Kramer Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I cover golf, luxury technology, and the intersection of the two. Following Sep 13, 2023, 09:00am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The GT2 electric scooter keeps safety in mind Isinwheel Im a devout electric bike rider and advocate. But in many ways, I actually prefer electric scooters. But they generally have lacked for safety in two areas. First, they should all be equipped with side view mirrors. Its dangerous moving forward on open pavement when you have to look back over your shoulder to make a turn. Any small rock you might hit while your eyes are diverted could throw you from the scooter. Thats why I bought an aftermarket one and attached it to mine. The second missing safety mechanism is turn signals. Until now. isinwheels GT2 has them included. And in my short time riding this new model, I feel loads safer riding because of it. Theres a left and right physical slider on the control panel thats super convenient to let cars behind you know youre turning. And on my very first ride with the e-scooter, I found myself using it five times. And cars did slow down, so they mustve seen it. But thats not the only cool thing on this 53-pound model. It includes an 800W motor, 48V 15Ah battery, 11-inch pneumatic off-road tires, front and rear disc brakes, and a bright LED headlight. It goes up to 28 miles per hour (more than enough speed) and with a range of 28 miles per charge, and holds people weighing up to 330 pounds. And it has an electronic horn button that's loud -- another nice safety touch. All of thats great, but Im marveling most over its cruise control that lets you glide around without keeping your thumb on the throttle. Unpacking it, I was surprised how well-protected the unit was inside the box. I needed to install and connect the headlight  not a big deal. Plus I realized that the handlebars are collapsible when it folds up  another great detail that helps save space. After I pulled it from the box and unwrapped all of the packing material, I unfolded it, extended the handles and locked them in, and was ready to go. The screen is colorful and informative. Plus its bright  seeing it under the California sunshine was no problem. And youd be surprised how many scooter screens are too dim to see in daylight.

There are three ride modes. I have been keeping it mostly in the fastest mode  turbo  which has no problem climbing the steep hills in my area at 18 miles per hour. I love that there are brake handles on both the left and right handles  another rarity among electric scooters. The handle neck also adjusts from 42.9 inches up to 53.9 inches. Im an even 6 tall and didnt even need to extend it all the way to the top. In other words, this accommodates riders of pretty much any height  the company claims people 4 to 67 tall. The base deck is nice and wide, too. The frame is made of an aluminum alloy. Ive only tested it on city streets, but the company advertises the scooters ability to go off-road, as well. For the latter, its equipped with a state-of-the-art front and rear suspension system. You can add an optional seat with pole, as well. And it comes with an attachable pouch that you can keep the charging cord and included tools in. Overall, its a well-designed machine with thoughtful details. And it made for a very pleasant riding experience. It sells for $999 but was selling at a reduced price on the company website at the time I wrote this. Follow me on LinkedIn .
