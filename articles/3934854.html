                Jack Fincham 'is axed from Celebrity Ex On The Beach' after being 'arrested on suspicion of drug-driving and using false plates on his car' By Kate Dennett and Connie Rusk For Mailonline Published: 00:54, 16 September 2023 | Updated: 01:00, 16 September 2023 e-mail View comments Jack Fincham has reportedly been axed from Celebrity Ex On The Beach and sent home from filming. It comes after the former Love Island winner, 31, was reportedly arrested on suspicion of drug-driving and using false plates on his car on August 26. Jack insists he has not been charged with drug-driving after the alleged incident on the A2, near Dartford, and his solicitor Conor Johnstone, from Maj Law firm, said he understands the number plates on his vehicle were private plates, not false plates. Now, it has been been claimed that Jack was in Gran Canaria to shoot for MTV's Celebrity Ex On The Beach when bosses axed him from the line-up for the new show. A show insider told The Sun : 'Jack had turned up to filming all ready to take part in the show - but then the news broke about his arrest. Development: Jack Fincham has reportedly been axed from Celebrity Ex On The Beach and sent home from filming 'The production team quickly convened a series of crisis meetings behind the scenes and in the end it was decided the best thing to do was to send him home.' MailOnline has contacted Jack's representatives and MTV for comment. It comes after it was reported that Jack, who won the 2018 series of Love Island, has pulled out of starring in the spin-off show Love Island Games at the last minute. Jack is said to have decided to step back from entering the All Stars villa in Fiji for the show - which will feature former stars from the past UK, US and Australian series - in favour of Celebrity Ex On The Beach , which he has now reportedly been axed from. 'He decided Ex On The Beach was a better fit for him - he'd prefer to do that show so he flew out yesterday,' a source told The Sun . Jack was reportedly arrested on suspicion of drug-driving and using false plates on his car on August 26. He is said to have been stopped by police as he travelled at high speed on the A2 near his home in Swanley, Kent. At the time of his arrest, Jack was given a blood test and held on suspicion of careless driving and driving without insurance, according to reports. He was then released under investigation until November 26. Stopped: It comes after the former Love Island winner, 31, was reportedly arrested on suspicion of drug-driving and using false plates on his car on August 26 Jack's solicitor Conor Johnstone, of M.A.J Law, told The Sun: 'Mr Fincham has not been charged with drug driving and denies any drug consumption whatsoever. 'There is no evidence at this stage that Mr Fincham drove whilst over the legal limit and we are hopeful that his blood results will prove the same.' His solicitor also said the TV personality is considering lodging a formal complaint against the police after becoming a 'target' by local police. In a statement on Thursday, Kent Police said: 'On Saturday 26 August 2023, officers arrested a 31-year-old man from Swanley on suspicion of drug driving, careless driving, driving without insurance and driving while displaying false number plates, on the A2 near Dartford. 'He has since been bailed until 26 November 2023.' Jack has just appeared on Celebs Go Dating after splitting from his girlfriend Jodie Ella. Speaking as part of the Original Penguin X Campaign Against Living Miserably Under The Surface podcast, he alluded to a villa return in the wake of Adam Collard and Kady McDermott's explosive comebacks. When asked about Kady, Jack, who was recently linked to Chloe Brockett and Frankie Sims before his romance with Jodie, said: 'Oh yeah of course I'd go back on the show. I'd love to. It's like a perfect environment to meet someone... 'You haven't got to worry about your phone or going to work or cooking. I'm not just trying to get out of work but yeah, I'd go back on the show in a heartbeat.' TV: It comes after it was reported that Jack, who won the 2018 series of Love Island (pictured), has pulled out of starring in the spin-off show Love Island Games at the last minute All over: Back in July, Jack revealed he had split from his girlfriend Jodie Ella While he admitted he 'gets a lot of attention', Jack confessed he is ready to find lasting love, saying: 'But actually I'm kind of ready to find someone... '[I want to] spend time with them. My little brother is 28 and he's been with his girlfriend for nine years and I think wow I'd love that now.' It comes as five more stars have been revealed as contestants on the new spin-off series Love Island Games. Megan Barton Hanson , 29, and Curtis Pritchard , 27, have 'already jetted off to film the new series' with host Maya Jama , 29, according to The Sun . The new programme, which is yet to announce the full cast, will feature former stars from the UK, US and Aussie versions. According to the publication, Danica Taylor , 22, who appeared on the UK show last year, is the third star announced to be taking part in the spin-off show. And she will be joined by US stars, Deb Chubb, Carrington Rodriguez, Cely Vazquez and Imani Ayan. Deborah, who has been single for five years, rose to fame on the show last year and is joining Carrington Rodriguez from the 2020 series of the US show. Cely Vazquez was a runner up on season two of Love Island USA and Imani rose to fame on season five of the show. Champions: Jack won the 2018 series alongside Dani Dyer Ready for love... again: It comes as five more stars have been revealed as contestants on the new spin-off series Love Island Games, including Megan Barton Hanson She's back: Danica Taylor, who appeared on the UK show last year, is also said to be taking part in the spin-off show Hunk: Carrington Rodriguez was on the 2020 series of the US show and will make making a swift return to the spin-off The current cast is to be a done deal and will soon be joined by a host of other Love Island stars from various versions of the hit dating show. Last week, a source told the publication: 'Megan and Curtis are both amazing signings for the spin-off and bosses are rubbing their hands together that they agreed to take part. 'They are two of Love Island's most memorable contestants ever - who could forget Megan turning every boy's head in the villa, or Curtis' brutal breakup with Amy [Hart]?'
