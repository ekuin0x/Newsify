                NEWS The 50-year influence of Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi was in display in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), during his funeral on Saturday. An avid supporter and crucial ally to the retention of the stature of the Zulu monarchy - Buthelezi (95) was supported by thousands of people who descended on his homestead. READ: Buthelezi deserves to rest in the most dignified and peaceful manner, says Induna yeSilo But, also on display was his complex political career. Businessperson Patrice Motsepe, his wife Dr Precious Motsepe, EFF leader Julius Malema, his deputy Floyd Shivambu and ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula. Although Buthelezi is primarily known for being the founder of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), history would not let him forget the beginnings of his career which were initially with the ANC. The politician and Zulu prince served as the traditional prime minister to the Zulu royal family from 1954 until he died in 2023. He was appointed to this post by his cousin King Cyprian Bhekuzulu, son of King Solomon kaDinuzulu. KaDinuzulu was the brother to Buthelezi's mother, Princess Magogo. Buthelezi was chief minister of the KwaZulu, a bantustan state, during apartheid and founded the IFP in 1975, leading it until 2019. He became its president emeritus soon after that. He was a political leader during Nelson Mandela's incarceration and continued to be so in the post-apartheid era. He was appointed by Mandela as minister of home affairs, serving from 1994 to 2004. At the peak of its autonomy, the IFP breakaway party was notorious for trails of bloodshed, maiming and decapitation of opposer. Although the 95-year-old mellowed in his twilight years, he was viewed as being the mastermind and instigator of many attacks on those opposing the apartheid system. READ: Sello Hatang | Navigating the divisive legacy of Mangosuthu Buthelezi The Ingonyama Trust is a corporate entity established by the provincial legislature as a repository for the communal land of the Zulu nation, with the king as the sole trustee. It oversees more than three million hectares of heritage land and the formation of the entity was the architecture of Buthelezi. A source close to the royal family said: Buthelezi was also known for a high regard for academics, some of these legacy builds include the formation of Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) and teacher training colleges in Pietermaritzburg and KZN. He also served as vice-chancellor at the University of Zululand.
