                Donald Trump could find himself staring down an audience made up not of his supporters but of 12 individual jurors who would hold his fate in their hands. FORT PIERCE, Fla.  He posts on social media for an audience of tens of millions and delivers speeches that have stretched for hours, veering off-script into diatribes that skewer his opponents and delight his supporters. But after he raised the possibility this week that he could take the stand in his own defense in the four criminal cases he faces, Just one person could hang a jury, acquitting the former president of the dozens of counts pooling around him. It's why E. Jean Carroll sought in the trial in her civil lawsuit against Trump to remove a juror who prosecutors said listened to a "notorious far-right" podcaster, according to unsealed court documents. And it could be why several of Trump's co-defendants in the Georgia case that charged him with trying to subvert the 2020 election moved to relocate it from Fulton County to federal court, where they could face a jury pool of people more likely to harbor friendlier political leanings. "You're going to get a better jury pool, possibly more conservative people, as opposed to a liberal jurisdiction like Fulton County," former Georgia prosecutor Chris Timmons said. The makeup of the panel is perhaps the earliest indicator of how the case will be decided and perhaps the last chance for the two sides to measurably shape a trial's outcome. "Once jury selection is done, the case is over," said Lisa Blue Baron, a nationally renowned jury consultant and trial attorney. The facts for Trump in the South Florida case are hardly in dispute  he has discussed keeping classified documents after leaving office. Prosecutors and defense lawyers will largely ask jurors to decide whether Trump's known actions violated the law  which could make each juror's views on him even more relevant. "The evidence is the evidence, but everyone sees it through their own filter," said Blue Baron, who has a background as a forensic psychologist. So central to a potential conviction is the impaneled jury that experts say there is Katherine Doyle
