                UAW strike: 13,000 General Motors, Ford and Stellantis workers in Detroit all walk off the job for first time in history amid demands for 40% pay rise Auto workers at Detroit's big three firms went on strike Friday The union is demanding a 40 percent pay increase and a four-day work week General Motors, Ford and Stellantis strikes could cost a $6 billion economic toll By Rachel Bowman and Stephen M. Lepore For Dailymail.Com and Associated Press Published: 15:41 BST, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 16:50 BST, 15 September 2023 e-mail 3 View comments About 13,000 auto workers at Detroit's big three firms stopped making vehicles and went on strike Friday in a historic first after their leaders could not bridge a gap between union demands and manufacturers in contract talks. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union's labor contract with Detroit's big three automakers, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, expired at 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, with their demands for a 40 percent pay raise for its 146,000 members across the US over four years and a four-day work week were not met. The car manufacturing giants have countered with offers that are roughly half of that increase. Starting workers are currently paid about $18.04 an hour. United Auto Workers (UAW) picket outside the Stellantis Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio after manufactures failed to reach a deal in contract talks General Motors workers picket outside the Wentzville, Missouri plant as the UAW union strike against Detroit's big three automakers for the first time in history Union contracts expired at 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, after demands for a 40 percent pay raise and a four-day work week were not met General Motors CEO Mary Barra said she is disappointed with where they are at but she is ready to go to the negotiating table and get back to work. 'This is a very, very strong financial offer. Again, along with world class benefits and health care. I think what our employees, is most important to them is job security,' Barra told Good Morning America . 'That's important when we are in the middle of a transformation from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles.' Stellantis said in a statement Friday: 'We are extremely disappointed by the UAW leadership's refusal to engage in a responsible manner to reach a fair agreement in the best interest of our employees, their families and our customers. 'We immediately put the Company in contingency mode and will take all the appropriate structural decisions to protect our North American operations and the Company.' An extended auto workers strike could have a massive impact on the economy. Anderson Economic Group estimates that a 10-day strike could result in a total economic loss of almost $6 billion. Automotive sales have increased this year. A Cox Automotive report found new-vehicle sales in July likely came in near 1.30 million, an increase of more than 15 percent from the year before. President Biden has spoken to Union president Shawn Fain and all three automaker CEOs. Members began picketing at a General Motors assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri , a Ford factory in Wayne, Michigan , near Detroit, and a Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio . It was the first time in the unions 88-year history that it walked out on all three companies simultaneously as four-year contracts expired. UAW President Shawn Fain (center) organized the historic strike in a effort to keep the companies guessing what might happen next and encourage deal making The General Motors world headquarters office is seen at Detroit's Renaissance Center Ford chief Jim Farley said on Wednesday that if the union strikes against his company, it's not Ford's fault because it has made four offers and hasn't gotten a 'genuine counteroffer' It threatens to bring production to a complete halt and trigger higher prices for buyers as well as cause major disruption for the companies. A 10-day strike is disruptive to the whole system. Fain wants full-time assembly plant workers at Ford and General Motors to earn $32.32 an hour and full-time staff at Stellantis to earn $31.77 an hour. He said starting wages have declined from 2007 and new workers at the time made $19.60 an hour, which is $28.96 when accounted for inflation . The union boss also pointed to how it took just three years to reach a wage of $28 an hour in 2007 but it takes around eight years to make $32 an hour now. The minimum wage in Detroit is $10.10 an hour and the average hourly wage is $29.81 an hour. As well as general wage increases, the UAW is seeking restoration of cost-of-living pay raises, an end to varying tiers of wages for factory jobs and a 32-hour week with 40 hours of pay. It is also calling for the restoration of traditional defined-benefit pensions for new hires who now receive only 401(k)-style retirement plans, pension increases for retirees and other items. In a call to members late on Wednesday, President Fain said the automakers have raised initial wage offers, but have rejected some of the union's other demands. The union argues a 40 percent pay increase matches what the company CEOs have received over the past four years As well as general wage increases, the UAW is seeking restoration of cost-of-living pay raises, an end to varying tiers of wages for factory jobs and a 32-hour week with 40 hours of pay Experts estimate a 10-day strike from the UAW could cost the economy up to $6 billion Ford offered 20 percent over four and a half years, while GM was at 18 percent for four years and Stellantis was at 17.5 percent. The raises barely make up for what Fain described as minimal raises of the past. 'We do not yet have offers on the table that reflect the sacrifices and contributions our members have made to these companies,' he said. 'To win we're likely going to have to take action. We are preparing to strike these companies in a way they've never seen before.' 'If the companies continue to bargain in bad faith or continue to stall or continue to give us insulting offers, then our strike is going to continue to grow,' Fain said. He said the targeted strikes, with the threat of escalation, 'will keep the companies guessing'. Analysis from Anderson Economic Group, an economic consulting firm, broke down the potential losses caused by a 10-day strike at each automaker. Ford Motor is expected to lose $1.49 billion, General Motor $1.466 billion, and Jeep-maker Stellantis $1.183 billion. Picketing outside the Stellantis Toledo Assembly Complex. Stellantis says the company has gone into contingency mode to protect operations Ford chief Jim Farley said on Wednesday that if the union strikes against his company, it's not Ford's fault because it has made four offers and hasn't gotten a 'genuine counteroffer'. 'It's hard to negotiate a contract when there's no one to negotiate with,' he added. The company, he said, has made a generous wage offer, eliminated wage tiers, restored cost of living pay increases and increased vacation time. 'It was fully competitive with all of the UAW-negotiated settlements, sometimes after strikes, with other industrial companies. And we heard nothing,' Farley said. The CEO said that his company has made four 'increasingly generous' offers since August 29. He claimed it has raised its wage offer, eliminated wage tiers and shortened from eight years to four years the time it would take hourly workers to reach top scale, and added more time off. The union disputes his contention that tiers were ended. President Joe Biden (left) listens to GM CEO Mary Barra (right) during a visit to the Detroit Auto Show. Biden has called all three CEOs to encourage negotiations Union officials will not bargain on Friday and instead will join workers on picket lines, UAW president Fains said It is the first time in history all three of America's unionized automakers have gone on strike at the same time All three automakers say an expensive labor agreement could saddle them with costs that would force them to raise prices above their non-union foreign competitors. And they say they have made fair proposals to the union. But Fain said their offers on cost-of-living adjustments were deficient, providing little or no protection against inflation. The companies rejected pay raises for retirees who haven't received one in over a decade, Fain said, and they are seeking concessions in annual profit-sharing checks, which often are more than $10,000. Stellantis said it gave the union a third wage-and-benefit offer and is waiting for a response. 'Our focus remains on bargaining in good faith to have a tentative agreement on the table before tomorrow's deadline,' Tobin Williams, the company's head of human resources in North America, said in a statement. 'The future for our represented employees and their families deserves nothing less.' General Motors insisted that it continues to bargain in good faith, making 'additional strong offers'. The last strike in the motor industry was in 2019 when General Motor workers walked off the job for six weeks. If they last a long time, dealers could run short of vehicles and prices could rise. The walkout could even be a factor in next years presidential election by testing Joe Biden s proud claim to be the most union-friendly president in American history. 'Workers all over the world are watching this,' said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, a federation of 60 unions with 12.5 million members.
