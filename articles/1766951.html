There is a "small chance of disruption from severe thunderstorms later on Sunday", according to the warning. Heavy rain is forecast across Cambridgeshire on Sunday afternoon. The weather warning said: "There is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds.
