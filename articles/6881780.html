                At The Forks in Winnipeg on Sunday afternoon, Ian Rabb facilitated a celebration for people recovering from addiction. Ive lost 45 people a year for the past few years, of families and people Ive worked with in addiction. So it usually is the sad stories, said Rabb, co-chair of Recovery Day. Hundreds of people dotted the field in front of CN Stage as music played, food trucks doled out snacks and people gathered to learn about addiction and recovery. Rabb said the event, which debuted in 2019, is about acknowledging the people who have made the journey of recovery from drugs and alcohol, and supporting those who are just getting started. Since its first iteration Recovery Day has grown, Rabb said. This years event featured keynote speaker Arnold McCuller. A musician by trade, McCuller has performed with the likes of James Taylor and Phil Collins.

I showed up for my dad. I kissed him on the forehead and I shaved his face and I told him, you can let go, its time to go. The following morning after I left his bedside, he passed away, he told the crowd gathered around the CN Stage at The Forks. The Sunday event also featured live music, activities and games for kids to make the event family-friendly, as family support is crucial in the process of recovery, Rabb said.
