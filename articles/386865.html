                Republic of Ireland 1-2 The Netherlands: Wout Weghorst winner piles further pressure on Stephen Kenny as EURO 2024 hopes take another hit Wout Weghorst scored the winner for The Netherlands against Ireland Adam Idah had given Ireland the lead before Cody Gakpo equalised Listen to the latest episode of Mail Sport's podcast It's All Kicking Off! By Chris Wheeler for the Daily Mail Published: 22:03 BST, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 23:16 BST, 10 September 2023 e-mail 3 View comments Wout Weghorst broke Irish hearts with the goal that almost certainly ends their hopes of automatic qualification for Euro 2024 and piles more pressure on manager Stephen Kenny. The former Manchester United striker, who struggled to impress during a loan spell at Old Trafford last season and now plays for Hoffenheim in Germany, climbed off the bench at the Aviva Stadium to complete Hollands comeback after Ireland had rocked Ronaldo Koemans side by taking an early lead. It was Irelands fourth defeat in five games in Group B and means they now trail Holland and Greece by six points in the race to qualify behind runaway Group B leaders France. Their next games are against Greece and Gibraltar next month, but it already looks like a hopeless task after losing what was dubbed a must-win game. Kenny had called on Ireland to produce the performance of their lives on a par with the famous 1-0 World Cup qualifying win over Holland in Dublin 22 years ago this month, and his players didnt waste any time in rising to the challenge. The game was seconds old when new Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken played a risky ball out from the back to Frenkie de Jong who was dispossessed by Alan Browne, and Alan Idah fed Chiedozie Ogbene whose effort was blocked by Mats Wieffer. Wout Weghorst scored the winning goal for the Netherlands in a 2-1 victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin Liverpool's Cody Gakpo drew the visitors level from the penalty sport after Ireland goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu committed a foul Adam Idah had given Ireland an early lead after Virgil van Dijk was penalised for handball in his own box It was only a temporary reprieve as captain Shane Duffy met James McCleans corner from the right and Bosnian referee Irfan Peljto ruled that Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk had handled inside his own box. It seemed a harsh decision given that the ball hit Van Dijks trailing arm and he had little time to react, but the penalty stood and Idah  deputising for the injured Evan Ferguson  converted from the spot after only three minutes. It was the catalyst for an excellent start from the Irish but Holland equalised with a penalty of their own in the 19th minute from their first attack of note. Duffy was playing Denzel Dumfries onside when he raced onto a throughball from Liverpool winger Cody Gakpo, and he was taken out by Gavin Bazunu. The Southampton keeper got a hand to Gakpos penalty but couldnt quite keep it out. Bazunu denied Donyell Malen twice before half-time and Ogbene failed to convert for a second time before the excellent Browne caught De Jong in possession again, and frustrated Dutch boss Ronaldo Koeman responded by sending on Weghorst and Tijjani Reijnders at half-time. The defeat for Ireland heaps further pressure on manager Stephen Kenny as qualification for Euro 2024 now looks unlikely Holland seized control of the game and both substitutes were involved in the goal that saw Holland take the lead in the 56th minute. Ireland inexplicably stood off as Reijnders played the ball to De Jong who lifted it over the top for Dumfries. The Inter Milan defender had three assists in Hollands win over Greece last week and he headed back for Weghorst to turn the ball home with a clinical first-time finish for his second goal of this international break. Ireland did their best to come back but required two goals to secure the win they really needed and couldnt trouble the Dutch again.
