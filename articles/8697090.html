                More than 17,000 people began the 42 kilometre marathon across the harbour city, but one winner carried the spirit of thousands more on his arm. More than 17,000 runners lined up for the Sydney Marathon, a record turnout for the event, and the biggest marathon held in Australia, according to organisers. Key points: Moroccan runner Othmane El Goumri dedicates his win to quake victims Moroccan runner Othmane El Goumri dedicates his win to quake victims The 31-year-old crossed in two hours and eight minutes The 31-year-old crossed in two hours and eight minutes More than 17,000 people took part in the race, making it Australia's largest marathon The beginning of the race at Milsons Point may have been packed, but the home stretch saw Moroccan long-distance runner Othmane El Goumri take the top spot, with a time of two hours, eight minutes and 20 seconds. The 31-year-old Olympian didn't think he would compete in the race after a devastating 6.8 magnitude earthquake destroyed rural villages in the Atlas Mountains north of the capital Marrakesh. El Goumri wore a black armband for the 2,900 victims. "I have loved ones effected by the earthquake," El Goumri said in Arabic. "I did not think I would come to Sydney, but thank Allah at the last minute I decided to come. "I was thinking about the people in Morocco while running, and this victory is for them."
