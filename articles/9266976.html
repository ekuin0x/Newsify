A SPECT scan of the heart refers to a non-invasive nuclear imaging test that uses radioactive tracers. These tracers are injected into the blood, in order to produce pictures of the heart. SPECT is used to diagnose coronary artery disease, as well as to detect a heart attack. SPECT can demonstrate how well the heart is working and how well the blood is flowing to the heart. Cardiac SPECT is mostly safe for people. The amount of radiation is small, and one's body is likely to get rid of it through kidneys, within about 24 to 72 hours. According to the WHO's most recent findings (taken from 2015 figures), an average of 74.6 CVD-related fatalities were observed in South Korea, for every 100,000 people, in a year. According to the 2018 article, "Current Status of Nuclear Cardiology in South Korea", in 2016, SPECT MPI (Myocardial Perfusion Imaging) had 12.8% share in the total gamma imaging studies. The recent installation of cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) cardiac-dedicated SPECT system in South Korea has brought even higher volumetric expansion of SPECT MPI. CZT SPECT-measured myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) are also available in the country. Hence, the promising results and clinical usefulness of CZT SPECT MPI may undoubtedly promote nuclear cardiology in South Korea Regional Coverage: The report's primary insights into various regions and the major companies involved in each one are provided in this section.
