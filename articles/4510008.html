                A North Korean defector center who asked to be identified only by her surname Kim attends a weekly rally near the Embassy of China in Seoul Monday Kims daughter is detained in China and faces repatriation to North Korea as the border between the two countries reopened in August Kim and other human rights activists urge China to stop deporting North Koreans escapees held there Korea Times photo by Shim Hyunchul This article is the first in a twopart series about North Korean detainees in China who are at risk of being repatriated back to the North  ED Defector seeks help to get daughter back as Chinas repatriation of North Korean defectors looms By Kang Hyunkyung A North Korean defector living in South Korea who wished to be identified only by her surname Kim panicked when she heard that the border between North Korea and China had reopened On Aug 26 North Korea said it would allow its citizens staying overseas  mostly in China and Russia  to return home and that they would be placed in quarantine for a week once they arrive in the North The announcement issued by the State Emergency Epidemic Prevention Headquarters and released by the state media signaled the reopening of the border more than threeandahalf years after the COVIDdriven border closure was introduced in January 2020 The news is an ominous sign for a North Korean defector like Kim who has a family member detained in China It is only a matter of time before her daughter who was caught in a Chinese government crackdown on illegal aliens and has since been detained in a prison in Chinas northeastern region is sent back to North Korea where she is sure to face severe punishment Kim said her heart sinks every time she thinks about the fate that awaits her daughter Torture rape and starvation are some of the common experiences many North Korean escapees have gone through in the Norths prison camps Pregnant women have experienced forced abortions and beatings are just a part of life in the brutal camps It feels like my heart is being torn apart Kim who lives in Gangwon Province said during a recent interview with The Korea Times She did not provide further details about her identity mindful of causing harm not only to her daughter held in China but also to her son who still lives in the North Kim said her daughter crossed the border into China years ago to survive Kim and her husband who were left to care for their other children were unable to feed them Ironically the choice her daughter made to survive has now put her in danger Shes a good girl and tried to help her family by making money in China Kim said Her eyes welled up with tears as she described what had happened to the girl Kims daughter was caught in April 2021 She and I talked over the phone that day But when I called her again she didnt answer Feeling anxious I called her again and again all night But she didnt answer That was when I realized something had gone wrong she said Before she was caught Kims daughter worked as a waitress at a restaurant run by a South Korean couple in the northeastern part of China After a sleepless night she heard from the female owner of the restaurant who called and said that her daughter had been arrested Kim was devastated She said she spent the last two years weeping while praying to God for help But her prayers were not answered Her daughter now faces an uncertain future Im a helpless mom here and my daughter is out there crying for help I feel guilty because theres nothing I can do to save my daughter who is at risk of repatriation Kim said as she sobbed I eat but feel no taste At night I close my eyes to sleep but end up staying up all night she added Oh Changhwa second from left a human rights activist and founder of the North Korea Club established to help North Korean defectors stages a rally along with other activists in central Seoul Monday to pressure China to stop sending North Korean defectors back to the North The sign he holds calls on China to guarantee the human rights of North Korean defectors Korea Times photo by Shim Hyunchul Like Kims daughter there are many other North Korean escapees detained in China Their number has soared due to tight border controls triggered by the COVID19 pandemic Some believe as many as 2000 North Korean escapees have been detained in China However some activists say that figure is exaggerated Seo Jaepyong president of the North Korean Defectors Association said the actual number of North Korean escapees detained in China stands at 200300 The estimates may vary But one thing that is clear is that a humanitarian crisis is inevitable if China adheres to its decadeslong practice of sending escapees back to North Korea China ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol which call for the protection of refugees and legal assistance for them However in order to justify its brutal repatriation policy China does not recognize North Korean defectors as refugees and treats them as undocumented aliens who illegally crossed the border for economic reasons Joel Atkinson a professor at the Graduate School of International and Area Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul said China has not been affected by outside criticism about its brutal repatriation policy and will continue to do so in the years to come The Chinese government has what Koreans would call a thick face brazenfaced  it is largely unaffected by any criticism he said Nothing is going to change its approach toward the North Koreans currently in detention Despite this he said the international community should keep building pressure on China to play by the rules Over the longer term if Beijing pays a high reputational cost for its cooperation with North Korea it will build pressure within China that the government is on the wrong track in its approach to human rights and relations with the world Atkinson said Human rights activists have begun to gather in front of the Chinese Embassy in Seoul for weekly rallies to put pressure on China to stop repatriating North Korean defectors On Monday Kim and dozens of activists held a news conference near the embassy About half of the participants at the rally were North Korean defectors Holding up signs written in Korean Chinese and English they urged China to live up to its commitments as a signatory of international refugee conventions Oh Changhwa a human rights activist and founder of the North Korea Club established to help North Korean defectors urged China to free the North Korean detainees Oh said the vast majority of the North Korean detainees want to come to South Korea to live He reminded China of its international duty as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and UN Human Rights Council to act responsibly He then urged China to recognize North Korean defectors as refugees and provide necessary help to which they are entitled Following his speech a female pastor read Kims letter pleading to China for mercy and to release her daughter Please help us I want to get my daughter back I would like to hug her and tell her how sorry I am for all of the ordeals she has gone through because she went to China for our family her letter read Repatriation means death My daughter is desperate and waiting for help from the outside Please help my daughter and set her free China has not responded to the weekly protests But Kim said she will continue to attend the rallies hoping to get her daughter back A passerby looks at activists holding a rally to call on China not to repatriate North Korean
