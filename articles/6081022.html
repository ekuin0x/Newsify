                United legend James Constable has returned to the club. The former striker, who is second on Uniteds all-time scoring record, is to take up the role of head of player care in the academy. Constable replaces another former Us player, the departing Eddie Odhiambo, who took the position last July. First of all I am so happy to be coming back to a club that means so much to me, Constable told the United club website. I loved playing for Oxford, have still been involved on matchdays and am excited to be back full-time. The role involves mentoring the young players in the academy, making sure everything is alright with them, working with the coaches and staff and building on the amazing work that Eddie did here. The academy is building and developing all the time and Im looking forward to helping in any way I can. Head of academy Stevie Kinniburgh added: Eddie did a wonderful job and we needed someone special to follow that up. James isnt just here because of his love for the club. He is here because he has excellent communication skills, he has that terrific work ethic that we all saw as a player, and he also has a different view that he can pass on to our young players. He didnt go straight into senior football, he had to prove himself and find a different route, in the same way that he has returned to football after a spell out of the game. He is a great role model and a fantastic ambassador for the club and I am sure everyone will make him more than welcome. Constable scored at Wembley in 2010, when United won promotion back to the Football League with a 3-1 win against York City in the Blue Square Premier play-off final. In total, Constable netted 106 goals for the Us, just one shy of the record held by Graham Atkinson. Ex-United defender Odhiambo tweeted last month that he would be moving onto a new challenge. He posted online: I have had great experiences and fast track development from my time as head of player care. The position revolves around leading and developing a player care package for players right the way through from Under-9s to Under-21s. Key responsibilities include mentoring young players while out on loan, supporting coaches with their understanding of player care, and providing supervision and support to players, families and those who provide accommodation for youngsters.
