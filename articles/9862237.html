NOMAD, the popular pizza cloud kitchen, has opened its first dine-in restaurant, and it's located in Khar. You can indulge in the brand's best-selling pizzas including their Naples, New York, Chicago deep dish, and Detroit styles. There are also some delicious appetisers, non-pizza mains and beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) on the menu.

The establishment has a live kitchen where you can get a clear glimpse of your yummy food being crafted from scratch. We had the chance to taste some of their offerings for ourselves. We recommend their Baked Vada Pav, Cheese Garlic Bun, Loaded Fries and House Special Pizza. Although the pizza was slightly sweetish, we loved the stringiness of the cheese and the range of toppings. Their hummus platter, with 5 different types of hummus, was also delicious. BakeLive Studio is a good place to hang out with your group of friends or to satisfy your cravings with some quick bites. BakeLive Studio also has outlets in Mulund and Colaba.

There is a full bar, with a limited but decent selection of mocktails and cocktails to pair with your food. There are also a few signature and fusion treats that we especially recommend.
