The West Suffolk MP, whose constituency covers Newmarket , will appear in the show which is set to air from September 26. Hancock was born in Chester and attended schools in the county before going to Oxford University where he graduated with a first class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics. He later studied at Christ's College at the University of Cambridge. He became the MP for West Suffolk in 2010 and has worked in several ministerial positions. In 2012, he trained as a jockey and won a horse race in Newmarket.

In June 2021, he resigned from the role after being caught on camera breaking social distancing rules by kissing and embracing a colleague, Gina Coladangelo. In November 2022, Hancock announced he would be appearing on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, although it was filmed while Parliament was in session. The announcement resulted in his losing the whip. The 16 celebrities taking part in this year's show (Image: Pete Dadds/Channel 4/PA Wire) Hancock was diagnosed with dyslexia at university and said he wanted to appear on the show to raise the profile of his dyslexia campaign. He finished in third place. Ahead of Celebrity SAS being aired, Hancock, 44, told PA: "Being on SAS was like nothing else Ive ever experienced. It's one of the toughest physical and mental things Ive ever done. It really opens your eyes and makes you look into yourself. "After coming through the most challenging period as health secretary during the pandemic, I wanted to push my limits. Its safe to say the course tested my resilience." Also taking part are singers Michelle Heaton and Siva Kaneswaran, TV personality Danielle Lloyd, former footballer Jermaine Pennant and former rugby player Gareth Thomas, as well as reality stars Montana Brown, Teddy Soares and Amber Turner. Comedian Zoe Lyons, actress Kirsty-Leigh Porter, British Olympian Perri Shakes-Drayton and Paralympic gold medallist Jon-Allan Butterworth will also feature in the upcoming series.
