                Former President Trump claimed on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was using what Trump described as President Bidens treatment of his political opponent to condemn the United States on the world stage. Trump, who has been indicted in but maintains his innocence, capitalized on of the charges he faces by suggesting they were giving the Russian dictator fodder against the United States. Its all happening, even worse than anyone projected, Trump in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, just after midnight Wednesday. President Vladimir Putin of Russia is using Crooked Joe Bidens illegal Banana Republic style treatment of his Political Opponent, who is beating him badly in the Polls, to condemn America and all of the good things it once stood for, Trump continued. The whole World is watching as the USA is being torn apart by dreams of Election Interference! The former presidents comments come a day after Putin claimed the prosecution of Trump reveals the rottenness of the political system in the United States. The Russian president also backed Trumps claims that the charges were political in nature. Everything thats happening with Trump is politically motivated persecution of ones political rival, thats what it is, Putin said in a speech. And its being done before the eyes of the U.S. public and the whole world. Theyve simply exposed their internal problems, he added. Trump, who is the current GOP frontrunner in the primary race, is likely to have a campaign schedule full of court appearances in the next year, as he faces criminal trials in New York, Georgia, Florida and Washington, D.C. Two of the four trials are related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
