                Rugby World Cup bosses WILL change teams' national anthems as they admit kids' choirs versions are 'disturbing' crowds who struggle to sing along... but chairman vows year-long project of 7,000 kids' work WON'T go to waste Organisers in France commissioned school choirs to record national anthems World Rugby bosses said on Tuesday there were no plans to change the anthems France 2023 have bowed to public pressure and confirmed 'newer versions' Latest Rugby World Cup 2023 news, including fixtures, live scores and results By Alex Bywater For Mailonline Published: 12:38, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 13:15, 13 September 2023 e-mail 1 View comments Rugby World Cup organisers have confirmed they have proposed that new versions of pre-match national anthems are used at the tournament in France after fierce criticism. World Rugby bosses had said on Tuesday there were no plans to change the controversial use of childrens choirs performing before kick-off. But in what amounts to a dramatic turnaround, France 2023 chiefs have now bowed to pressure and will alter how the anthems will be delivered. France 2023 chairman Jacques Rivoal said he wanted the new delivery of the anthems to be closer to expectations and added: The proposed new simplified versions, while preserving the children's voices, will not have this way of singing which will not be disturbing for the spectators. The decision by French officials to commission school choirs made up of students from diverse backgrounds to do renditions of the national anthems was met with unanimous disdain from supporters on all sides after the first round of pool matches. New versions of pre-match national anthems have been proposed following fan criticism Fans had complained the use of children's choirs were impacting the pre-match atmosphere France 2023 chairman Jacques Rivoal admitted organisers were concerned by the feedback Fans from all nations, including those who have travelled to France and also those watching at home, argued the childrens choirs sucked the life out of the pre-game atmosphere and made it difficult to sing along. Moving forward, the delivery of the anthems in France will still contain the use of childrens voices but also utilise a more traditional orchestra. The move is set to be popular with rugby fans, many of whom see the anthems as a key part of rugbys patriotic fervour. We wanted to add an artistic perspective to the anthems and want to honour the 7,000 children who have been working on this project for the last year, Rivoal added. The feedback was the national anthems were more disturbing to our fans. The fan experience is very important to us and we were quite concerned by the feedback. Its a sensitive issue. Today we have proposed new versions or simplified versions of the anthems while preserving the childrens voices. We are reworking the anthems and we hope these versions will be well received. Rivoals comments came at a World Cup press conference in Paris to review the first weekend of action. The anthem debate dominated given supporters, pundits and players had widely criticised how they were being sung. France 2023 tournament director Michel Poussau also had his say. We definitely understood the feedback and unfortunately it hasnt worked as well as we would have hoped. Hopefully the new versions can combine the best of both worlds, he said. Poussau also said he was confident there would be no more repeats of the fan chaos which came at Englands opening World Cup win over Argentina in Marseille. Organisers have expressed hope the newer versions will meet the expectations of fans France 2023 say they are confident there will be no repeats of fan chaos that impacted who were stuck outside Stade Velodrome ahead of England match against Argentina First weekend of 2023 World Cup statistics 200,000 replica team shirts sold. 15.4million viewers watched matches on French TV. 429,000 fans watched matches live. 276,000 visited rugby villages in the host cities. <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/sport/rugbyworldcup/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement Supporters attending the game struggled to access the stadium and many missed kick-off. Irish and Welsh fans in Bordeaux also had similar experiences. We are confident in our organising committee to address these challenges and find relevant solutions, Poussau said. We want to eliminate some of the frustration of the fans. Rivoal added: We want to send our sincere apologies to fans who came after the game had started. The day after England met Argentina, Scotland faced South Africa in the same city and there were no such travel problems after World Cup organisers stepped in. Mail Sport asked tournament organisers for their response to the news an Irish rugby fan was allegedly abducted and gang-raped by three men while in Bordeaux at the weekend. Rivoal and Poussau lamented the incident which is being investigated by French police. The issue didnt occur in the stadium. We really regret what happened but it was not our responsibility, Rivoal said.
