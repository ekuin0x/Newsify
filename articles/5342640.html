The Met Office is currently forecasting thunderstorms in Cambridge, Ely and Peterborough as well as other areas of the county. At present the thunderstorms are expected between around 3pm and 4pm, according to the hour-by-hour weather forecast - with a 60-70 per cent probability according to the Met Office. This is of course subject to change and the storms may arrive sooner or later than expected or not at all. A thunderstorm weather warning was in place across much of Cambridgeshire on Saturday afternoon. This is no longer in force for the area, with a second thunderstorm warning in place for much of northern England on Sunday afternoon not stretching as far south as Cambs.

Becoming cloudier from the southwest later, culminating in a risk of gusty torrential downpours, mainly in the west. Hot and humid once again. Maximum temperature 32 °C."
