                A growing number of the worlds richest entrepreneurs are using their wealth to fight aging. Theyre taking supplements, abiding by austere fitness routines, and investing millions into longevity research. Business Insider Over the two-day [Longevity Investors Conference] event, scientists and biotech founders made the case for various approaches to prolonging the number of years we might spend in good health. And the majority of them were trying to win over deep-pocketed investors.  How old would you guess I am? No need to say it out loud, just picture the number in your head. Now take that number (Im no mind reader, but its fifty-nine), bump it up by a college sophomore, and youve got my true chronological age: seventy-eight. Shocked? Of course you are. These sure dont look like a septuagenarians earlobes: zero droop, no unsightly hair. Im not too humble to say ityou might be looking at the youngest old man on Gods big blue orb. And its all thanks to technology that youll learn about today, because you made the smart decision to be wealthy enough to be invited to this years Prolongitek V.I.P. Investors Cruise. Give yourselves a round of applause. No hard claps, just finger tapsyou dont want to end up with workmans knuckle. I hope you enjoyed todays Longevity Lunch of 2.5 ounces of low-oxygen air and a high-altitude gooseberry. Now that youve super-activated your spine methyl, its time to get to the dilemma that has plagued philosophers for centuries: Why should man be cursed to age and decay, while his money remains immortal? Well, many high-net-worth visionaries have been seeking the answer, and theyve found it in Prolongitek. So, what is this breakthrough? Dont listen to the anti-prosperity crowdits far more than a protein-rich pudding. And, trust me, it goes way beyond blood transfusions from a teen-age gibbon. Im going to say some powerful words to you now: A.I., crypto, telomeres, cell rejuvenation, , skin juice, meta-shirt. Prolongitek is pouring research into all of these, and, I promise you, not a drop of that research is woke. This is your time. Youve given so much to earn your wealth, and now youre ready to give future generations the incredible gift of more of you. The years you add to your life will be vital and fulfilling. You will be surrounded by loved ones who admire your dedication to spending nineteen hours a day in a trough of omega-3-nutrient jello. But we cant get to the future if we accept the old, conventional wisdom that people die. No, sir. Thats why you must act now. Please direct your attention to Mr. Flintock Feister, one of our Infinity Tier investors. Flin, give us a blink. There he is, right next to the Crown Princes attach, looking as robust as the day he founded the Caldera Group. Would you believe that Flintock is still C.E.O. at the chronological age of a hundred and six? That number even makes laugh, or produce some sort of noiseless joyful scream. I see the outgoing-message light flashing on Flins communication pad. Folks, he just sent this to me: I may be a hundred and six, but, thanks to Prolongitek, my biological age is ninety-one! followed by a bunch of pornographic . And they say bone mass peaks at age twenty-nine! Im joking, because laughter is the best medicine, which is why tonights Endurance Dinner is an I.V. drip of distilled macaw laughter. Our friend Flintock has already put a significant sum of Swiss francs behind Prolongitek, and hes not alone. I cant divulge our other big-name backers, but lets just say one of them runs a major social-media company and has already replaced his skin with a sun-resistant polymer. Another is a leader in generative computing who wants to live to see the A.I. revolution that he paid for. As do I. In fact, I do this work because I hope to be around when machine intelligence rules supreme, and treats humanity with the same sympathetic dignity that we show lesser creatures. Which reminds meits time to end the rumor that Prolongitek is just packets of powdered dolphin scrotum. Now lets bring out the infant. Dont be alarmedhis parents signed a very generous N.D.A. This little guy is teaching our scientists about the youthful microbiome, in between scheduled fun in the Stimulation Atrium. Be honest, everyone, whos got smoother cheeks, me or him? O.K., O.K., Im not quite there yet. But with Prolongitek Im catching up, baby! Great, back to the cryonics play lab with you. Ah, I see its time for my evening life-enhancement regimen of two hours on the stair-climber in lunar atmospheric conditions. Its not easy, but its worth it. Much like the decision youre about to make regarding your personal fortune. Before you do, I urge you: imagine your millions of fellow-citizens, of every race, creed, and social status, who stand to benefit from your choice today. They get your estate tax only if you die. Dont let them have itinvest in tomorrow now!
