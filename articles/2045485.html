                YORK City defender Levi Andoh is set to face a lengthy spell on the treatment table after suffering a fracture in his back two weeks ago Andoh has been one of the standout performers in a bleak start to the season for York impressing in defence since joining the club from Vanarama National League North side Hereford Newlyappointed manager Neal Ardley confirmed that whilst Andoh was set for spell injured there was some good news on the horizon with Alex Woodyard and Callum Harriott both close to a return to fulltime training Alex Woodyard has been out hes back into his running work and hell be back training next week as hopefully will be Callum Harriott They wont be available we know Lenny Lenell JohnLewis has his final game of his suspension Levi has got some bad news this week he landed on his back a couple of weeks ago and it looks like hes fractured the bottom of his back which might be a longerterm one Duckworth is still trying to get through his Achilles so weve got several players that arent going to be available Weve got a couple that couldnt train earlier in the week and have only joined in in the back end of the week I can make not excuses but loads of doubts and reasons its going to be 32 degrees here tomorrow and a tough day But the boys are ready we had a good day today announced the squad and did work on the team today I feel like in two days Ive really prepped them for tomorrow Whether if we can transfer that with no anxiety onto the pitch tomorrow who knows but Ill try to take the pressure off of them and hopefully they can play freely Its absolutely 100 per cent up to me to pick the team With my eyes and what Ive seen what I always say when I see the staff and walk through the door I want your opinion and not mine I dont want a yes man Im comfortable in my own shoes for people to challenge me and give their opinion Ill always listen to it Ive always got to be the one to make the final decision because its my neck on the line Ive done my homework on Boreham Wood I know what theyre about and I know Luke Garrard Boreham Wood manager well hes an excellent manager Ive got to try and look and think how we win the game think of the players weve got available and the players we dont have available even that will dictate the shape I have to play Theres no point me trying to play a 442 if weve only got one forward the shape will be dictated by what Ive got available Monday Ill come in and start trying to sort lots of other things out thats not to do with Saturdays game Ardley also confirmed that he was open to letting players leave the club with the squad looking too big at this current moment in time Of course there is too many players The owners have come in and are really good Ive been really impressed with them Have they got everything right in there first minutes of doing it probably but theyve probably got some things wrong with great intentions They wanted to bring some good players into the club theyve tried to do Yes there are too many yes we need to go along and work out what the squad is going to look like and work it from there Financially it is unsustainable it will help to filter it down so the boys know this is us now this is the core Thats got to be done the right way Its a blank canvas for us all its not going to happen overnight
