                Mick Jagger puts on a VERY animated display as he watches England v New Zealand at Lord's after being gifted a VIP box at The Oval for his 80th By Ruth Francis For Mailonline Published: 20:12, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 20:55, 15 September 2023 e-mail 2 View comments Mick Jagger appeared in good spirits as he enjoyed watching England v New Zealand at Lord's cricket ground on Friday. The Rolling Stones frontman, 80, who was gifted his very own VIP box at The Oval for his birthday, was seen gasping and cheering energetically from a box during the tense game. He was joined by the president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, Mark Nicholas, who looked on admiringly. Sir Mick rocked a dark blazer with a patterned shirt layered underneath and dark trousers. He completed his look with a black hat in typical flamboyant fashion. Edge of your seat stuff: Mick Jagger appeared animated and in good spirits as he enjoyed watching England v New Zealand from a box at Lords on Friday Big fans: Joined by the president of the MCC, Mark Nicholas, both men who were dressed in smart blazers and shirts looked on at the game intently As he sat engrossed in the match, the Gimme Shelter hitmaker was seen looking onto the field intently with one hand on his hip and the other clenched in anticipation. At one point, he looked on open mouthed at the action that was happening in front of him, with the result ending in England winning by 100 runs. It seems to be becoming something of a tradition for Sir Mick to enjoy watching the sport from a box. The musician who is a keen cricket supporter, was gifted his very own box from The Kia Oval cricket ground for his 80h birthday in July, which costs 999 per person per match. An inside told The Sun : 'Mick is a huge cricket fan and has always wanted a box at The Oval, his family have been trying to get him one for years but demand is huge and the waiting list is massive. 'They finally managed to secure one and Mick was bowled over when he was told about it on his birthday, previously Mick has borrowed boxes from pals including Sir Tim Rice but now he finally has one of his own. The insider added: 'Having a box at The Oval is incredibly expensive and extremely coveted so he feels very lucky that his family worked so hard to make it happen for him.'
