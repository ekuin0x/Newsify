                Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis apologized Saturday for character letters the celebrity couple wrote on behalf of fellow "That '70s Show" actor Danny Masterson before he was sentenced for rape this week. A judge in Los Angeles on Thursday sentenced Masterson to 30 years to life in prison for raping two women in 2003. In their letters, first published by Los Angeles court reporter Meghann Cuniff and journalist Tony Ortega , the couple vouched for Masterson's character and pleaded with Judge Charlaine Olmedo for leniency. "While I'm aware that the judgement has been cast as guilty on two counts of rape by force and the victims have a great desire for justice. I hope that my testament to his character is taken into consideration in sentencing," Kutcher wrote. "I do not believe he is an ongoing harm to society." "I wholeheartedly vouch for Danny Masterson's exceptional character and the tremendous positive influence he has had on me and the people around him. His dedication to leading a drug-free life and the genuine care he extends to others make him an outstanding role model and friend," Kunis wrote. "From the very beginning, I could sense his innate goodness and genuine nature," she added of Masterson in her letter. "His caring nature and ability to offer guidance have been instrumental in my growth both personally and professionally." In a video posted on Instagram , Kutcher and Kunis said they were sorry for the pain they may have caused with the letters, which were made public Friday. Kutcher said the letters that asked for leniency "were intended for the judge to read and not to undermine the testimony of the victims or retraumatize them in any way. We would never want to do that and we're sorry if that has taken place." Kutcher said Masterson's family approached them after the actor was convicted in the rapes in May and asked them to write character letters describing "the person that we knew for 25 years." The letters were posted online by The Hollywood Reporter and other digital publications. Masterson starred with Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Topher Grace in "That '70s Show" from 1998 until 2006. He had reunited with Kutcher on the 2016 Netflix comedy "The Ranch," but was written off the show when the Los Angeles Police Department investigation was revealed the following year. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo handed down the sentence to Masterson, 47, after hearing statements from the women, and pleas for fairness from defense attorneys. Both rapes took place in Masterson's Hollywood-area home in 2003 when he was at the height of his fame on the Fox network sitcom "That '70s Show." The victims testified that Masterson drugged them before violently raping them. Kunis said in the apology video that their letters did not mean to undermine the testimony of victims. "Our heart goes out to every single person who's ever been a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or rape," she said.
