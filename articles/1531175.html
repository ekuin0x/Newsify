                NBCs streaming service has spent 2023 striving to confound anyone and everyone whos already passed judgment on the 3-year-old service and who considers it an also-ran in the Streaming Wars. For months now, with the steadfastness of The Little Engine That Could, has been releasing , everything from Natasha Lyonnes to the Kaley Cuoco dramedy to thats loosely based on his own life  as well as the outrageously bonkers (from the creator of and ), which for better or worse is like nothing else youll see on TV this year. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the Add series like those and others to Peacocks older library titles  including the super timely and well-made Putin-focused docuseries or 2010s , the cast of which is reuniting in November for a  and it makes for quite a satisfying mix of content, indeed. And thats even before you get to the category of top-rated, cant-miss Peacock shows, three examples of which youll find below. For the month of September, wed like to recommend three Peacock series that subscribers ought to seek out, including Peacocks upcoming prequel series that arrives later this month as well as two older titles: A video game adaptation, and a British sitcom about an all-female Muslim punk rock band. Without question, the biggest thing to hit Peacock in September will be , a three-part series that serves as a prequel to the John Wick movies and is set in and around the noirish, foreboding hotel chain for bad guys thats such an iconic component of the movies. Its focus will be the suave, debonair character of hotel owner Winston Scott  a man who holds a lofty position in the criminal underworld but who, apart from his friendship with Wick and his closeness with The Continental receptionist Charon (whos also Winstons right-hand man), is something of a blank slate. Beneath his many terse quips (And away we go) theres a suggestion of a complex and dangerous past. He has a tattoo of the Ruska Roma on one wrist and drinks martinis with three olives. We know almost nothing else about him, other than that hes clearly survived a long and brutal game. Moreover, if you were worried about the TV show not living up to the quality of the movies when it comes to the fight scenes, maybe this will ease your mind: The three-part event will explore the origin behind the iconic hotel-for-assassins centerpiece of the universe through the eyes and actions of a young Winston Scott as hes dragged into the hellscape of 1970s New York City to face a past he thought hed left behind, reads Peacocks series description of . Winston charts a deadly course through the hotels mysterious underworld in a harrowing attempt to seize the hotel where he will eventually take his future throne. As for this next Peacock gem  Forgive me, but I thought it was par for the course for live-action video game adaptations to generally pretty dumb, a mess, or overall forgettable affairs. Peacocks take on the Twisted Metal franchise, starring Anthony Mackie and Stephanie Beatriz, has no business whatsoever being this funny, this addictive, this good. The plot: Based on the classic PlayStation game series, follows, per the streamer, a motor-mouthed outsider offered a chance at a better life, but only if he can successfully deliver a mysterious package across a post-apocalyptic wasteland. With the help of a badass axe-wielding car thief, hell face savage marauders driving vehicles of destruction and other dangers of the open road, including a deranged clown who drives an all too familiar ice cream truck. Finally, if like me you found Nida Manzoors feature film directorial debut a lovely and deliriously entertaining contender for all the year-end Best Movies of 2023 lists, here is your assignment: Put her six-episode sitcom on your watch list this instant. Manzoor  who regarding her passion for music that I wanted to be a brown girl Bob Dylan before I wanted to do screenwriting  is still a relatively young director but already has two projects under her belt that I consider near-perfect. They are the aforementioned , a heartwarming drama about the power of sisterhood thats also sprinkled with everything from martial arts action to a tribute to Bollywood, along with razor-sharp British wit and a raised middle finger to the hierarchies of social class. And the other is , which is both the name of the show as well as the female band portrayed in it (Lady Parts). The story unfolds from the perspective of Amina Hussain  a geeky microbiology PhD student, Peacock explains, whos on the lookout for love and who the band recruits to be its unlikely lead guitarist when  intimidating frontwoman sees something in Amina. However, the other members  taxi-driving drummer Ayesha, cartoon-drawing bassist and backing vocalist Bisma, and the bands wheeler-dealer band manager Momtaz  are not convinced she is right for their band. Amina has never met girls like this before, and shes soon swept up in their joyful, anarchic energy and punk spirit. But she becomes torn and caught up between two different worlds  that of her more strait-laced university friends led by her bestie Noor and the world of Lady Parts.
