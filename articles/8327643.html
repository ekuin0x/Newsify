                Sand Casting Market Is Likely to Experience a Tremendous Growth by 2029 09-15-2023 09:37 AM CET | Energy & Environment Press release from: Orion Market Research The global sand casting market is anticipated to grow at a considerable CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period. The major factors driving the sand casting market are advancement in technology and cost-effectiveness. Tooling and Equipment International (TEI) has witnessed considerable changes in casting techniques. Sand casting has a long history and it has remained unchanged for years. However, things are changing now due to 3D printing. 3D printing for sand casting methods gives prominent results. For instance, in July 2020, ExOne launched a Sand 3D Printing Network which is prepared by 40 binder jet printing platforms in North America. Through this technology, ExOne S-Max and S-Print platforms provide high-quality 3D printed sand molds and cores to manufacturing industries in a short period. This technology is beneficial in removing human error which leads to advancement in the shapes of final products. Owing to improved technological solutions there is an opportunity for the market to grow. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-1692778413989-2"); }); The Polyjet technology used in sand casting applications is beneficial for cost-saving and reduction in time for the production of the product. It is considered less expensive in comparison with die casting and investment casting due to the low-cost equipment used in the sand casting process.
