                SACRAMENTO  California lawmakers are debating nearly 1000 bills during the hectic final two weeks of the Legislative session Heres action taken by the California Legislature Thursday Religious institutions and nonprofit colleges in California could soon turn their parking lots and other properties into lowincome housing to help combat the ongoing homeless crisis lawmakers voted on Thursday The legislation would rezone land owned by nonprofit colleges and religious institutions such as churches mosques and synagogues to allow for affordable housing They would be able to bypass most local permitting and environmental review rules that can be costly and lengthy California is home to 171000 homeless people  about 30 of all homeless people in the US The crisis has sparked a movement among religious institutions dubbed yes in Gods backyard or YIGBY in cities across the state with a number of projects already in the works But churches and colleges often face big hurdles trying to convert their surplus land and underutilized parking lots into housing because their land is not zoned for residential use An affordable housing project in a San Jose church had to go through a rezoning process that took more than two years before it could break ground in 2021 The goal of this legislation is to carve an easier path to build muchneeded housing in the state said Democratic Sen Scott Wiener who authored the bill The bill which was approved by the Assembly needs the final approval in the state Senate before heading to the desk of Democratic Gov Gavin Newsom who will decide whether to sign it into law It would only apply to affordable housing projects and the law would sunset in 2036 Democratic Assemblymember Sharon QuirkSilva who represents Orange County said there are hundreds of faithbased organizations and several community colleges in her district that could use this bill as a tool to expedite affordable housing projects If only a small fraction of them chose to build very small amount of units we could start picking away at this issue one church at a time one educational institution at a time she said Thursday Supporters of the bill said it could help add hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units to the states housing stock A recent study by the University of California Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation estimated California religious and higher education campuses have more than 170000 acres 68797 hectares of land that would be eligible under the bill But several cities opposed the bill and said it would take away local control over housing developments Environmental groups also worry the bill doesnt have enough guardrails and would put lowincome housing close to polluting areas such as freeways industrial facilities and oil and gas plants Lawmakers have until Sept 14 to act on this and other bills When lawmakers finish Newsom will have a month to decide whether to sign them into law The Legislature passed a bill to ensure school curricula reflect the cultural and racial diversity of California and the US The bill would also require school boards to approve instructional materials that include accurate depictions of LGBTQ people and their contributions It would ban school boards from rejecting textbooks because they mention the contributions of people with a particular racial background or sexual orientation Its an issue that has cropped up in many states The issue garnered renewed attention in California when a Southern California school board Temecula Valley Unified rejected an elementary social studies curriculum that included materials mentioning Harvey Milk a former San Francisco politician and gay rights advocate Newsom threatened the school board with a 15 million fine The board later reversed course State senators debated intensely on the bill They took a timeout after Democratic Sen Susan Talamantes Eggman who chairs the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus said Republican Sen Rosilicie Ochoa Boghs comments about the bill were off topic Republican lawmakers and Democratic Sen Marie AlvaradoGil voted against it Ochoa Bogh said the bill wouldnt make sure that school materials would be ageappropriate for students But Democratic Sen Lena Gonzalez said school boards would still be able to make those decisions Later in the day the state Assembly gave final signoff on the bill sending it to Newsoms desk Democratic Assemblymember Corey Jackson who introduced the proposal touted it as a chance to show the nation that California would be on the right side of history A yes vote means that not on our watch will these political class wars be declared and use our students and our children as pawns Jackson said But Republican Majority Leader James Gallagher said the bill would overstep on local school boards authority to approve class materials The state Assembly passed a bill that would extend the life of a landmark law streamlining rules about housing projects in cities that have not met statemandated goals for affordable housing The bill is one of the most contentious pieces of housing legislation this year Since the original bill took effect in 2018 it has helped fasttrack 18000 homes with roughly 75 of them being affordable housing according to the bills author Democratic Sen Scott Wiener The new bill would remove the requirement to hire skilled and trained workers a provision typically sought by the powerful construction trades union and instead require workers to be paid prevailing wage which is the average wage paid to workers laborers and mechanics in a particular area Related Articles The bill had met fierce opposition from the state Coastal Commission and environmental groups in July because it would remove the exemption on streamlined housing development in coastal zones Opponents worried the bill would place housing in areas prone to sealevel rise or wildfires and make way for luxury apartments not affordable housing along the coastline Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks a coauthor of the bill said the legislation only applies to coastal areas zoned for multifamily housing and that Wiener has worked with the commission to address critics concerns The Coastal Commission no longer opposes the bill Were extending current law so its not scary Wicks said Thursday Its the right thing to do We know this program works The state Assembly on Thursday approved a bill to require schools serving first through 12th grade to have at least one genderneutral bathroom available for students by 2026 The legislation would apply to schools with multiple female and male restrooms The bill comes amid debates in California and elsewhere about the rights of transgender and nonbinary students including whether teachers should notify parents if their child changes pronouns at school ___ Austin is a corps member for the Associated PressReport for America Statehouse News Initiative Report for America
