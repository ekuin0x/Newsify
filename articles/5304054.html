                Prisoner is 'stabbed in the neck at HMP Wandsworth exercise yard and is fighting for his life' It comes just 24 hours after escaped terror suspect Daniel Khalife was captured By Matt Strudwick Published: 13:48 EDT, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 15:18 EDT, 10 September 2023 e-mail 10 shares View comments A prisoner is 'fighting for his life after being stabbed in the neck at HMP Wandsworth' today. The inmate was stabbed by another prisoner in the exercise yard at the category B prison. He has undergone emergency surgery and is said to be in a critical condition. Emergency services rushed to the prison at around 3pm with an ambulance and air ambulance being called. The inmate was taken to a major trauma centre where he is said to be in a critical condition and 'fighting for his life'. Police were also called at around 3.20pm with the incident reportedly between two prisoners. No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing, according to The Mirror . The incident at HMP Wandsworth was reportedly between two prisoners. A Prison Service spokesperson said 'staff swiftly responded' A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'Staff swiftly responded to an incident between prisoners at HMP Wandsworth today. 'We have a zero tolerance approach to violence and will always take strong action against those who break these rules.' A father was visiting his son inside the prison at the time and saw two ambulances enter the grounds. He told Sky News the stabbing happened in one of the communal areas. 'It's just another day at Wandsworth jail - you do worry as a parent,' he said It comes just a day after terror suspect Daniel Khalife was arrested by police officers following four days on the run from the prison. He was snared by anti-terror police after they and MI5 and MI6 combined forces, bugged phones and raided a 'safe house'. His four days on the run ended at 10.41am yesterday when an undercover operative pulled him from a bike as he cycled along a canal towpath. Around 40 inmates have been moved out of HMP Wandsworth in the wake of terror suspect's escape from the south-west London prison. Justice Secretary Alex Chalk revealed the action had been taken 'out of an abundance of caution' amid a probe into how Khalife was able to stage a jail break.
