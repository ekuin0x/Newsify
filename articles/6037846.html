                Next level petty genius I love it Teen neighbour kept cutting through my garden on way to school  so I got revenge A man has been hailed a petty genius after revealing how he managed to stop his teenage neighbour from using his front lawn as a shortcut The gardening fan shared his own brand of revenge after trying for months and months to stop the culprit from walking through his flowerbeds Taking to Reddit to share his story he wrote We live in the end house on our street which has a slight curve For almost the last year Ive noticed that twice a day  on the way to and from school  the same teenager cuts across our front lawn I asked him to stop ages ago but he has not Its beginning to leave a noticeable path of thinnedout grass from being walked on excessively The kids went back to school yesterday after the summer and I noticed him do it again in the morning For all the latest on news politics sports and showbiz from the USA go to The Mirror US Fed up with his behaviour the man decided to teach him a lesson  Image Getty ImagesWestend61
