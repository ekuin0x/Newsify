                Terrifying moment 'XL Bully' dog mauls 11-year-old girl in the street before crazed animal chases and attacks two men who tried to wrestle the youngster free: Suella Braverman commissions 'urgent advice' on banning the 'lethal' breed The nightmare unfolded in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, yesterday afternoon DID YOU WITNESS THE INCIDENT? Email natasha.anderson@mailonline.com By Dan Sales and Natasha Anderson Published: 15:43 BST, 10 September 2023 | Updated: 20:20 BST, 10 September 2023 e-mail 261 shares 376 View comments This is the horrific moment an XL Bully dog attacks a little girl before going for two men trying to save her. The nightmare bite attacks unfolded as the animal's owner was taking it for a walk on Saturday afternoon in Bordesley Green, Birmingham . A video circulating online which was taken from the top deck of a double-decker bus showed the rampage erupt. The little girl's arms was chomped on by the animal before a man managed to pull the dog off her. She ran into a shop for safety as the XL Bully was held on the floor but it then managed to escape. The dog sprints after another man, who is seen on the film wearing a while t-shirt and shorts. He is chased onto a petrol station forecourt where he was attacked before the animal is hit and stops the attack. Home Secretary Suella Braverman is now pushing for a ban of the American XL Bully breed, arguing they are a 'clear and lethal danger' - particularly to children.

West Midlands Police were investigating after the girl and two men who intervened were injured in the incident in the Bordesley Green area yesterday. 'This is appalling. The American XL Bully is a clear and lethal danger to our communities, particularly to children,' Ms Braverman wrote on social media. Is THIS the deadliest month for dog attacks? Experts warn heatwave is fuelling spate of vicious animal attacks <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/nl/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement 'We can't go on like this. 'I have commissioned urgent advice on banning them.' The advice was commissioned last week, an adviser said, with it being the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' responsibility to add the breed to the banned list. Despite being outlawed in the UK almost 200 years ago, authorities have warned dog fighting in Britain is on the rise and these type of breeds are the first choice. The muscular American Bully XLs can display'unnatural' savagery because it had been instilled in them through violent training and years of inbreeding. Bloodshed is now spilling out onto the UK's streets, with the animals responsible for the majority of fatal dog attacks since 2021 amid a boom in their popularity, with Bully XLs increasingly being used by celebrities as status symbols. There is no suggestion the dog in this video was anything other than a pet. Today West Midlands Police launched an investigation into what went wrong. A force spokesman said: 'We're investigating after three people were bitten by a dog in Birmingham yesterday. 'An 11-year-old girl ran past the dog as it was being walked by its owner in Bordesley Green, when she was bitten. 'Two men intervened but were bitten and left with injuries to their shoulders and arms. With their 'hair-trigger response' and 'desire to kill', the muscular American Bully XLs are the 'fighters' of choice in this disturbing underworld, with experts saying the horrific levels of savagery displayed by the dogs are 'unnatural' and instilled in them through violent training and years of inbreeding. 'They were taken to hospital to be treated for their injuries. 'The dog was initially taken to a local vet to be checked over before being taken into secure kennels while the investigation continues. 'The owner of the dog has been spoken to by officers.' This is the latest in a series of dog attacks in the hot weather. As the mercury has been rising, so have the reports of killer canines setting upon victims including a woman who died after being mauled by Rottweilers and a number of children who have been scarred for life. Emma Chandley, a practising vet with Perfect Pet Insurance, said that summer highs 'lower the thresholds for violence' in humans and animals, warning: 'Dogs are more likely to attack and bite in the warmer summer months. As with humans, tensions tend to rise as the temperature does. Teaching assistant Katie Deere, 31, was with her own dog when she was suddenly set upon by an unsupervised bully XL breed Miss Deere had already picked up her own dog out of concern for the loose aggressor, which ran across the road and clamped its jaws on her arm 'From my experience, dogs are more likely to bite on hotter days and days when the air pollution is higher,' she told the Daily Express . Yesterday the MailOnline exclusively revealed the rise of the Franken-Bully , a 'mutant' breed of the American Bully XL that some experts fear are 'too dangerous to live'. Underground breeders are creating giant 'mutant crossbreeds' by mating banned pitbulls with legal mastiffs and bulldogs to evade dangerous dogs laws. It comes amid fresh calls for XL Bullys to be banned in Britain after shocking data revealed the breed has been involved in the majority of fatal dog attacks in the UK since 2021. Two in four deadly dog attacks in the UK in 2021 involved the XL bulldogs - rising to six in 10 in 2022, and fears there could be many more fatalities if urgent action isn't taken to stop the rise of the generically engineered American crosses from reaching Britain's shores. She was rushed to hospital by ambulance, bleeding from wounds to both arms Stitches on Miss Deere's arm. She fears if the victim had been a child 'they would have been killed' The mother was due to start a new job this month but is now recuperating and making twice weekly hospital visits Severe injuries to Ms Deere's hand. She described the attack as 'like an out-of-body experience' Teaching assistant Katie Deere, 31, was also with her own dog when she was suddenly set upon by an unsupervised bully XL breed. Miss Deere had already picked up her own dog out of concern for the loose aggressor, which ran across the road and clamped its jaws on her arm. The quick-thinking single mother pushed the pushchair towards a passer-by who stopped to help and her own dog ran away.

Thankfully a lorry driver who witnessed the attack stopped and bravely intervened  pulling the dog off her and calling for an ambulance. She was rushed to hospital by ambulance, bleeding from wounds to both arms. The traumatised victim later underwent five hours of surgery on her arms, including 50 stitches and repair to a finger that was partially amputated. She is now recovering with relatives and an aunt who has set up an online fundraising appeal said they had discovered Miss Deere is 'not entitled to any sort of compensation or government help as the dog was uninsured and owned by a minor.' The incident happened at 11am on August 17 in Askern, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Meanwhile, tragedy struck yesterday when a woman, 40, died after two Rottweilers savaged her legs and arms when she tried to say help to them.

She was rushed to hospital after the dogs pounced and had been discharged to go back home. But she collapsed at her Brighton-le-Sands home on Sunday and was sadly pronounced dead. Two in four deadly dog attacks in the UK in 2021 involved XL bulldogs - rising to six in 10 in 2022, including high-profile maulings that killed children Jack Lis, 10, and Bella-Rae Birch, aged 17 months.

It comes as shocking footage on social media has shown how the dogs chase down some of their victims, with one video in London capturing the moment one of the beasts tackles a screaming woman to the floor while it tears chunks of her flesh off. Only this week it was revealed two Bully XLs were responsible for killing 22 pregnant sheep and injuring 48 others in a frenzied attack in Wales that forced a farmer to shoot both of the dogs. Meanwhile, police forces across the UK say they are increasingly being called out to seize or destroy the animals - which shares the DNA with the banned American Pit Bull Terriers but that are not on Britain's list of dangerous dogs. In July, horrifying footage showed the moment two police officers in South Yorkshire were attacked by a Bully XL , with the incident leading to a warning from one of the county's top cops, who said Britain could no longer 'ignore the fact that the XL bully breed is disproportionately represented in the number of dog attacks'. The situation comes as Britain is gripped by an epidemic of dogfighting, with the RSPCA saying it has attended an average of 30 incidents a month this year. Horrifying police body-worn camera footage shows the moment two officers in South Yorkshire were attacked by an American Bully XL The dog can be seen mauling one of the officers in the footage, released by police in July of this year While in London, one woman was filmed being attacked by a Bully XL as she screamed and begged for help as the beast dragged her to the floor Pictures show how Bully XLs are forced to run on make-shift treadmills amid claims some of the animals are whipped or kicked by their owners to make them more aggressive. And there is evidence of a low-level group of wannabe dogfighters obsessed with the culture of 'strong' dogs. These animals may not take part in matches, but they are trained to be aggressive, risking injury to other pets and people. Meanwhile, pictures on social media show how other owners are 'training' their dogs, letting the animals dangle from ropes by their teeth to strengthen their jaws and biting power. Other owners appear to allow their animals to sink their teeth into tree branches as they while dangling in the air. Dr Lawrence Newport, a law and criminology lecturer at Royal Holloway University recently published a detailed report on the Bully XL, and was worried by the trend. He told MailOnline the dog's violent upbringing by savage owners had led to them having a 'hair trigger response' and a 'desire to kill'.
