                The definition of chaos in Washington is when Speaker (R-Calif.) to try to oust him, and the Justice Department of pro-background checks on a felony weapons charge. The nations capital was in rough shape on Thursday and may not look much better next week. The government appears highly likely to run out of financing without a new infusion at the end of the month. A GOP impeachment inquiry, just launched, could sour voters on House conservatives. House Democrats say they , and a once-collegially productive Senate suddenly over appropriations. McCarthys colleagues cant agree on bedrock defense and national security spending measures  and some colleagues would rather shutter the government than keep the lights on, even short-term. More about McCarthy, and what the president calls   in a minute, but first theres also a major labor strike and a hurricane in the headlines.  Biden with Ukrainian President next week around the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York City.  Seven million people are under tropical storm warnings in New England . The hurricane is expected to affect the Northeast U.S. and Canada before its this weekend along the Maine or Nova Scotia shorelines.

Members of the United Auto Workers union walked off the job at midnight after failing to reach agreements on a new contract with Ford, General Motors and Chrysler maker Stellantis ( and ). UAW President who negotiated on behalf of his unions 150,000 workers since July, said work stoppages are underway at three plants: a GM site in Wentzville, Mo.; a Stellantis center in Toledo, Ohio; and a Ford assembly location in Wayne, Mich. Fain, pointing up the chasm between the union and automakers, previewed adding,  : The UAW had been seeking a 40 percent wage hike over four years (amounting to 46 percent compounded), along with cost-of-living increases; beefed-up retirement benefits, including pensions on par with what autoworkers previously received; and full pay for a shortened 32-hour workweek, down from 40 hours ( ). The union wants workers to benefit from corporate profits since the last contract in 2019, and to account for inflation.  : The U.S. auto companies, chasing Tesla and battling to dominate the next generation of the car industry, are embarked on a major transition that places expensive to replace the combustion engine. Annual gross profits since 2019 have risen by 34 percent at Ford and 50 percent at General Motors. Stellantis, which formed when Fiat Chrysler merged with the French automaker Peugeot in 2021, reported that its annual gross profit rose by 19 percent from 2021 to 2022.  : If the work stoppage spreads to many plants and lasts 10 days or more, it will be costly for the auto industry and the U.S. economy  perhaps as much as $5.6 billion, according to projections by Anderson Economic Group ( ).  : Biden  who describes himself as the most pro-union president in history and wants to overcome iffy job approval ratings on the economy as he seeks a second term  risks a hit after predicting as recently as Labor Day that a strike would not occur ( and ). Hes considering emergency aid to suppliers, who could be affected by the strike ( ). House lawmakers spent all of three days in Washington this week as GOP tempers flared, ambitions to get defense and homeland spending measures on and off the floor came to naught and McCarthy set aside, for the moment, efforts to placate GOP firebrands and in an about-face, called their bluff about ousting him as Speaker. On to Plan F. The GOP majority will return next week with yet another option, which would appear to have long odds: working toward a 30- to 60-day stopgap spending bill and taking up major appropriations bills simultaneously. There are eight legislative days until the government runs out of funding. The odds of peaceful GOP coexistence and comity seem long. McCarthy deadpanned to reporters Thursday. The stormy mood was contagious, spreading from the House to the Senate, . Conservatives  in what had been described hours before as a united chamber  began to drift apart, seeking changes to a noncontroversial spending package that had strong bipartisan support. Suddenly the bill came to a halt. : GOP spending turmoil comes to the Senate. Rep. (R-Idaho), a powerful House appropriator, told reporters. Senate Republicans, worried about a small band of House conservatives who oppose another dime for Ukraine aid, are on board with a plan to jam their House colleagues. They expect to add Ukraine funding to a stopgap funding bill and then send it back to the House shortly before the Sept. 30 deadline. Their idea is to pressure the Speaker to bring it to the floor and then turn to House Democrats for final passage. The downside of this plan is that collaborating with Democrats is seen by House renegades as a firing offense, perhaps inviting a motion to vacate McCarthy from his Speakership, a move that could halt all House floor action until the infighting was somehow resolved ( ).

Though Romney, Manchin and Sinema are oft maligned by both parties faithfuls, the possible 2024 departures of two or three of them would change the Senate, which passed several notable bipartisan deals in the last Congress due in part to the chambers moderate wing ( ). Manchin said. Biden, who headed to Maryland to tout Bidenomics and contrast it with MAGAnomics, or Republicans economic vision, asserted that the funding they proposed this summer would raise costs for families, lower taxes for the wealthy and cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The White House earlier Thursday rolled out a memo that warned against so-called MAGAnomics, arguing that Bidens and Trumps differing economic agendas will as Congress works to avert a government shutdown later this month.
