                For all of his claims to be working on content moderation billionaire Elon Musk has allowed neoNazi accounts to proliferate across X the rebranded platform previously known as Twitter wrote tech analyst John Gruber in a scathing analysis this week This comes in response to independent multimedia journalist David Leavitt flagging several facially antiSemitic accounts that the site has explicitly said do not violate policies including accounts with names like J3wsAreBad and gasthejews6969 These sorts of accounts wrote Gruber should be two of the easiest reports of your day to deal with if you are a content moderator on the platform You dont even need to look at any of their tweets  both of their usernames should be sufficient on their face to just delete them No warnings no suspension just nuke them There should be no more question whether these accounts should be deleted than there is whether a turd ought to be scooped off the sidewalk Instead wrote Gruber these accounts are welcome on Twitter POLL Should Trump be allowed to run for office All of this comes at a moment when Musk who has caused chaos with a series of impromptu rules changes since taking over the site is under fire for escalating attacks against the AntiDefamation League one of the most renowned Jewish advocacy groups even threatening to sue the organization for allegedly causing Xs drop in ad revenue with allegations of antiSemitism on the platform It also comes as he increasingly interacts with and signalboosts farright content on the platform and pushes conspiracy theories about billionaire philanthropist and Holocaust survivor George Soros a favorite target of antiSemites This issue concluded Gruber has nothing to do with any sort of reasonable criticism of or disagreement with the AntiDefamation League Rather its about the fact that the platform has a big blinking Welcome Nazis neon sign Antisemitism is more than just a form of bigotry and hatred its a millennia old conspiratorial crackpot worldview  And Elon Musk is seemingly sinking into it The full unredacted version of the Fulton County special grand jury report issued to District Attorney Fani Willis was released on Friday morning The report sections of which were published earlier this year in a heavily redacted form reveals several new details about the investigation that led to criminal racketeering charges against former President Donald Trump and 18 codefendants for trying to block the certification of the election results in that state Among other things the full report shows that the special grand jury recommended even more sweeping charges than have been issued so far Among the individuals recommended for criminal charges were South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham and former Georgia Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler Read the full report here  CONTINUE READING Show less Elon Musk was insistent on building selfdriving robotaxis that were impossible for humans to operate and he became grumpy when his engineers objected for safety reasons The Tesla CEO was so obsessed with the idea that he shot down his own plan to build a 25000 electric car in favor of robotaxis which he predicted would earn their owners more than 30000 a year by dispatching them to run errands or give driverless rides to other people according to excerpts from Walter Isaacsons new book published by Axios  There is no amount that we could possibly build that will be enough Musk said according to Isaacson Someday we want to be at 20 million a year Musk became convinced that robotaxis would eliminate the need for people to own cars but his engineers pushed back on some of his plans to remove the capability of humans drivers to operate them because they werent confident the companys full selfdriving technology FSD would be ready POLL Should Trump be allowed to run for office If we go down a path of having no steering wheel and FSD is not ready we wont be able to put them on the road Teslas longtime chief designer Franz von Holzhausen told Musk in August 2022 The designer urged Musk to accept cars with a steering wheel and pedals that could be easily removed later when the FSD tech was ready but the CEO stubbornly stood his ground No mirrors no pedals no steering wheel Musk said This is me taking responsibility for this decision However his deputies continued to resist and Isaacson wrote that Musk sank into one of his very cold moods Let me be clear Musk said slowly according to the book This vehicle must be designed as a clean robotaxi Were going to take that risk Its my fault if it fcks up But we are not going to design some sort of amphibian frog thats a halfway car We are all in on autonomy Ultimately his deputies eventually persuaded him to cover his bet in a nonchallenging way Isaacson wrote CONTINUE READING Show less Republican Kari Lake who traded in a career as a local news broadcaster to run for governor of Arizona only to suffer a brutal loss is now blaming her failed political career on Google which led a local columnist to ridicule her latest defeat rationalization  According to Arizona Republic columnist Laurie Roberts  Lake latched on to the sketchy conclusion made by Robert Epstein a psychology researcher who has posited that Google interfered and stole votes from Donald Trump dating back to his 2016 presidential bid claiming it has a bias against conservatives that steers undecided voters to their opponents This led Lake to turn to her Twitter account and write DrREpstein is the foremost expert on how Googles censorship  manipulation of search results manipulate the outcome of elections He just testified before the House Ad Hoc Committee on Oversight Accountability  Big Tech this interference CHANGED the outcome of our race  POLL Should Trump be allowed to run for office The margin of victory is only 6 Lakes war room account added The full extent of these manipulations absolutely changed the outcome of the gubernatorial election Noting that Epsteins claims have been debunked previously Roberts suggested Lakes problem with voters didnt lie with Google but with Kari Lake who chased them away In particular her attack on McCain Republicans turned off a substantial number of conservatives in the state who also turned against Donald Trump It was lost on the Friday before the general election when Lake sneered at  the party of McCain  during a campaign event and told McCain Republicans to  get the hell out  Roberts wrote before adding It was lost a little bit every day as she slashed and burned her way through a 17month campaign in which she made it clear that she didnt need  or want  the support of moderate Republicans and independents as she marched ever onward with her America First movement As the columnist pointed out McCain Republicans  simply granted her wish Now it appears shes about to do it all over again with rants about the uniparty swamp and spineless Republicans and we the people  as if that is a group exclusive to those who march on the far right side of the road Roberts wrote before adding Lake lost because Republicans having apparently learned nothing from 2018 and 2020 were determined to nominate another crop of Trumpendorsed MAGA candidates who cannot win in a general election You can read more here  CONTINUE READING Show less
