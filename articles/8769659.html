                t only took 49 days for Liz Truss to tank the British economy. Imagine what a decade could do? Ms Truss is shamelessly thinking about just that. She is now working on a book, , to be published in April next year. The west had better watch out. Ms Trusss tome is unlikely to deliver the mea culpa the public deserves for and sending interest rates spiralling upwards . The shortest-serving prime minister in British history is likely to double down on her misjudgments. Ms Truss blames her downfall on a Trump-esque conspiracy involving a of British business, the International Monetary Fund and US president, Joe Biden. Good luck with that on the doorstep. She should not be able to recommend new peers or give gongs to those involved in her catastrophic time in No 10. Amazingly, is attempting a comeback via the pages of The Daily Telegraph and under the auspices of the , a powerful conservative thinktank based in Washington. Its not hard to see why, given the ideological preferences of most Tory MPs. Ms Truss wanted lower taxes, especially those levied on the wealthy, and less regulation. At the same time, she was more than happy to bang the drum on culture war issues, claiming Brexit was failing because it had not been properly tried. As a politician she believed in burning rather than building bridges. This was a problem as her rival in last summers leadership race, Rishi Sunak, won the greatest share of support among Tory MPs. Market speculators, correctly, assessed her government to be weak and divided. Investors didnt share Ms Trusss confidence that her would generate the she hoped for. Crucially, Ms Truss failed to prepare the ground for her dash for growth with the or the . Her downfall began with a and was sealed by the sacking of her . The irony was that Ms Truss was felled by the markets she so fervently admires. Whatever reputation for the Tories had was lost. Ms Truss is not the exception but the rule in the Conservative party. Her low-tax, deregulatory agenda sends thrills up the spines of many Tory MPs. Her hawkishness on may irritate the Foreign Office, but it is cheered on the backbenches. While Mr Sunak criticised her plans as fairytales, its magical thinking that the Tories want. The , run by former Truss cabinet ministers, wows rightwing audiences with calls to abolish . When he took over as prime minister, Mr Sunak suggested that he would lead his party out of the hole it had dug. With the number of small-boat crossings , NHS going up and the economy , the Tories have not stopped digging. For most Britons, politics is of only passing interest between big votes. Ms Truss feels for many like a fever dream. One pollster reported that a focus group participant insisted the former chancellor  not Ms Truss  was prime minister for a month and screwed it all up. Mr Sunak lags Labour in the polls because of the of 13 years of Tory rule extending beyond the brief Trussite term. But those who Ms Trusss time in office was not all that bad for Britain must think that the Titanics voyage was a success because some people survived on life rafts.
