                Page signed a four-year deal exactly 12 months ago as Wales prepared to make their first appearance at a World Cup for 64 years. But their fortunes have plummeted since and Page faces a potentially make-or-break Euro 2024 qualifier in Latvia on Monday. Wales must beat bottom side Latvia  who are yet to register a point in Group D  to keep alive hopes of a top-two place and automatic qualification for next summers finals in Germany. Asked at his pre-match press conference whether he was under pressure from the Football Association of Wales executive to qualify, Page said: I cant let that affect me. I cant think about that. Ive got a job to do. I want to qualify for me, as a Welsh supporter myself. As the manager, I want to be in this job for the rest of my contract. I really enjoy working with this group of players. Pressed further on whether he was fighting for his job, Page replied: We are in an industry where you need to win games of football. We are in a period of transition as well. I cant influence what the board or people above do. All I can worry about is winning games of football and giving it my best shot. We move on to   Wales  (@Cymru) If I do that and it doesnt work out for me, then at least I can walk away with my head held high. Wales warmed up for their trip to Latvia with a goalless draw against South Korea on Thursday. Page said he saw plenty of positive signs during that Cardiff clash and Wales were further boosted by Fridays set of results in their qualifying section. Group favourites Croatia left Latvia dispirited with a 5-0 thrashing, while Turkey and Armenia drew 1-1. Wales would draw level on points with Armenia if they win in Riga and Croatia do likewise in Yerevan  and move within three points of Turkey with a game in hand. (Turkey and Armenia drawing) was probably the best result for us, Page said. MD-1   Wales  (@Cymru) It would be nice for Croatia to get another win for them to run away with it and have us fighting it out for second spot. We want to win the game. Its all about the points for us. It doesnt matter if its 1-0. They are off the back of a tough game but they have been in games right up until the 90th minute. We cant wait for it off the back of a positive performance against Korea. I didnt want the game because I didnt want to risk injuries and weve picked up an injury from that game as Wes (Burns) came on and he tweaked his hamstring. There is a generation of supporters who have seen Wales qualify for major tournaments. Losing players makes the job harder, but expectations say that we should be qualifying. Its not as easy as that. We will continue to try and qualify for every tournament.
