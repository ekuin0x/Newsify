                NEW DELHI  The Future Investment Initiative Institute (FII Institute) has introduced the international community to its works and activities, aiming to make a positive impact on humanity. This came during the FII Institutes participation in the "Media Oasis" event held on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders' Summit, which commenced yesterday in the Indian capital, New Delhi. The FII Institutes engagement in such global platforms is aimed at boosting its international standing and continuing its focus on several critical issues concerning the international community. These issues encompass health, the global economy, technology, education, and climate, all of which are major challenges that countries find difficult to address individually. Through its participation, the FII Institute also seeks to stay informed about the latest outcomes of the G20 Summit and continue this dialogue at the 7th edition of the Future Investment Initiative Conference scheduled to take place in Riyadh on Oct. 24-26, 2023. The conference, themed "The New Compass," will bring together decision-makers, international leaders, investors, and academics from around the world to discuss these issues, as well as other matters of international concern. Through this year's conference theme, "The New Compass," the FII Institute is venturing into new horizons across all directions, aiming to answer a wide range of universal questions on various topics by bringing together leaders of the relevant institutions and sectors for an open and transparent dialogue with the entire world. By participating in the "Media Oasis," organized by the Ministry of Media, the FII Institute aims to introduce itself as a global non-profit foundation whose agenda revolves around a single goal, which is " Impact on Humanity." The foundation operates through four main pillars, focusing on only four areas: artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, education, healthcare, and sustainability.  SPA < Previous Page Next Page >
