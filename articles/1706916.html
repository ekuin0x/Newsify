                Amended motion calls on party to 'take a practical approach to lowering carbon emissions as a substantive move to nuclear power is made' A Barnaby Joyce-backed push to strip net zero from the Nationals' policy platform has effectively been defeated as the former leader's shadow cabinet position is brought into question<br> Joyce backed a motion to strip net zero emissions by 2050 from the party platform at its national conference in Canberra on Saturday<br> The former party leader had previously brokered a deal to support it when in government with then-prime minister Scott Morrison<br> Joyce slammed the target but his bid to have the party abandon it ultimately failed when the motion was amended to remove reference to the policy<br> It now calls upon the parliamentary team to "take a practical approach to lowering carbon emissions as a substantive move to nuclear power is made"<br> A vote for the amended motion was expected to take place on Sunday<br> Joyce argued against stripping reference to net zero, saying you couldn't oppose the methods required to get there  such as transmission lines and methane emission reductions  and support the target<br> "It's just counterintuitive and counterfactual to what you have to do," he told the conference on Saturday<br> "This is an issue that is moving politics <br><br><br> because we can't wait<br> "It's happening to us on the land right now and the crowds are growing and the anger is furious<br>" It was almost a direct rebuke to the Nationals leader, David Littleproud's Guardian staff reporter
