                embers of have tried to kill themselves due to the almost unsustainable nature of the job, a former Conservative minister has said. Former international development secretary said it is a miracle that some of his former colleagues have not died by suicide, while others have had total breakdowns in public. Speaking ahead of publication of his new memoir, Politics On The Edge, Mr Stewart also said he despised the creeping MP he became before leaving the in 2019. I dont want to talk about the specifics because this is deeply personal to people but, yes, colleagues tried to kill themselves, he told GB News. Colleagues tried to kill themselves. These are people I knew. And in very serious ways - I mean they almost killed themselves. Its a miracle they aren't dead SPONSORED These are people I knew. And in very serious ways  I mean they almost killed themselves. Its a miracle they arent dead. There were other colleagues who had total breakdowns in the most humiliating, personal, embarrassing fashion possible, in public. He went on: I think it is because the gap between the way that are encouraged to present themselves to the public and who they really are is almost unsustainable. Its mad, because youre pretending to be all-knowing, perfect, dynamic, confident. You are pretending that youve got the answers to everything, and that I know where were going. The truth is, this is a country of 70 million people, and politicians dont really know whats going on. And yet we pretend to the public that we do. Asked how he felt when he was an MP, he said: I ended up despising myself. I would find myself sort of creepily trying to sit next to David Cameron at lunch, and Id send these texts saying, you know, Congratulations on your latest policy that I didnt really believe in. And so I began to feel that I was being made, in my early 40s, into some kind of child. Id been the acting governor of an Iraqi province responsible for three million people, and a Harvard professor, and Id run a charity in Afghanistan. I thought that I was a reasonably substantial person. And I realised that, as soon as I became an MP, all that was wiped out. Nobody takes you seriously anymore. But the former Tory leadership candidate said he wished he had become prime minister. Asked if he wished he was now in the top job, he said: Yes, I do. I think it would have been a pretty tumultuous ride. Its not been easy  , Covid  but I felt that we had a real opportunity in 2019 to try to bring the country together a bit more. I felt it was terribly kind of divided and fractured. He said he parted ways with the Conservative Party because I belong to a tradition of a much more centrist, more traditional conservatism, adding: Also, I dont feel comfortable in the direction that the partys going at the moment. But he said he is not a Labour supporter and believes that both major political parties are basically old, dead and broken. He said that, while there are some wonderful people at Parliament, there is also a group of people who are very, very bitter  unfortunately, mostly men  who feel passed over and feel that their basic mission in life is to try to humiliate other people. Mr Stewart went on to tell Sky news it is a miracle that Britain manages to keep going because of the political system. He said: The truth is, you could not run a fish and chip shop in the way in which the British Government is run. Its insane. It's a miracle that Britain manages to actually keep going at all the way that we run our politics And I tried to do a good job Its not (that) the politicians are necessarily incompetent or daft. Its these jobs are mad. It cannot make sense to put somebody into a job as important as that for just a few months. He added: We need governments that say you must remain in (post) for a minimum of two years in these jobs, unless you actually have a horrible scandal. And we need to look to the American system where we have genuine professionals as Cabinet ministers it is a very limited gene pool, MPs  youre taking out about 300 MPs, putting them into these positions. And, look, Im obviously attacking myself in Politics On The Edge, because Im trying to show how ignorant I was and what a disgrace it is that someone like me gets these jobs. Mr Stewart continued: I went in idealistic, very, very proud to be in Parliament, thinking Im going to make a real difference, Im going to change the world. And I found that the system and structure just did not work. The whips, the party system, these ministerial promotions, the culture of the place was fundamentally not serious. Its a miracle that Britain manages to actually keep going at all the way that we run our politics.
