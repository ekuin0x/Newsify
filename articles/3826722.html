                Upcycled Cosmetic Ingredients Market Expected to Reach $433.5 Million by 2031-Allied Market Research 09-18-2023 05:42 PM CET | Advertising, Media Consulting, Marketing Research Press release from: Allied Market Research According to a new report published by Allied Market Research, titled, "Upcycled Cosmetic Ingredients Market," The upcycled cosmetic ingredients market size was valued at $231.48 million in 2021, and is estimated to reach $433.5 million by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 6.6% from 2022 to 2031. In 2021, the skin care upcycled cosmetic ingredients segment accounted for the majority of the total upcycled cosmetic ingredients industry. Upcycled cosmetics are made from previously discarded plant-based waste to create new cosmetic components. Traditional ingredient lists, which are frequently harmful to humans and the environment, can be replaced with upcycled cosmetic ingredients. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("div-gpt-ad-1692778413989-2"); }); Get Sample Copy of Report Here: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/54019 Food crops are a top priority because climate change is putting additional strain on available agricultural land around the world. The United Nations estimates that by 2050, the world may need to produce 50% more food than it did in 2010 to feed its expected 9.3 billion people. Nearly one-third of the food produced in the U.S. for human consumption is wasted. Food waste misuses the resources used in its production, processing, transportation, preparation, and storage. Food loss and waste exacerbate the climate change dilemma by producing large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG). It accounts for about 6% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Food waste reduction and elimination can improve economic efficiency, productivity, and climate change mitigation. It can also address resource and energy conservation while reducing supply chain shocks caused by climate change. Food waste can be used in a variety of industries to become an important ingredient. In the cosmetic industry, for example, tomato or olive seed debris is used as cosmetic components to keep organic waste from decomposing in landfills and emitting greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. As a result of the increase in pressure to reduce food waste and the effective use of food waste as a raw material in the cosmetic industry to reduce the environmental impact increasing the upcycled cosmetic ingredients market demand during the forecast period. There is an increase in food waste being repurposed as basic ingredients in the cosmetics industry. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted supply networks for cosmetic chemicals, providing additional impetus to the organization. According to AMR analysis, as the cosmetics industry develops goods for a circular economy and shifts to regional supply chains for raw ingredients, the adoption rate of upcycled ingredients is projected to rise. Food by-products, also known as food side streams, are already recognized as a natural component source. Many cosmetic and personal care products contain certain ingredients, such as palm kernel oil. Consumer demand for natural and organic personal care products has increased the demand for such raw materials. Other important upcycled cosmetic ingredients market trends are sustainability and preference for natural ingredients, with cosmetic and ingredient companies promising to incorporate more plant-based and natural ingredients into their cosmetic formulations. The demand for new crops of botanicals used as cosmetic ingredients, as well as the costs associated with their production, processing, and packaging, can be reduced by using by-products. Monocultures used in the cosmetics industry can be resource-intensive and harmful to biodiversity. Producing rose essential oils, for example, may be considered unsustainable because it takes 5 tons of rose petals to produce 1 kilogram of oil. Although the process of upcycling ingredients requires the use of energy, water, and other resources, it can be done in a sustainable manner. Extensive research is usually carried out to trace their origins and the morality of their production from farm to the supplier before purchasing upcycled ingredients. As a result, unsustainable methods of obtaining the ingredient may hamper the upcycled cosmetic ingredients market growth.
