written to the judge in the case of convicted rapist Danny Masterson , prompting even more wrath, including from Jane Doe #1 aka Jen B<br> Journalist Yashar Ali shared on X the woman's reaction to the Hollywood couple's clip<br> He wrote: 'Jane Doe #1 aka Jen B, one of the women Danny Masterson was convicted of raping, just texted me her reaction to Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis' video<br>' The message from her said: 'This video was incredibly insulting and hurtful<br> My hope is that they learn radical accountability and the importance of self-education to learn when to keep their privilege in checkespecially Ashton, who claims to work with victims of sex crimes<br> And as to Mila, I can only think of "Times Up<br>"' Critics were quick to take to X, formerly known as Twitter , to unleash their dismay over the 'lawyered' apology<br> Disgraced: Ashton and Mila wrote letters to the judge of Danny Masterson's case vouching for his character, igniting backlash from fans Their video has been slammed by as 'insulting' by a woman their friend was convicted of raping Masterson was handed a 30 years to life sentence earlier this week after a jury found him guilty of raping two women in the early 2000s They posted the video after it was revealed that he and his wife had vouched for their former That 70s Show co-star and friend, 47<br> Ashton, 45, began the short video: 'We are aware of the pain that has been caused by the character letters we wrote on behalf of Danny Masterson<br> 'We support victims,' Mila, 40, added<br> 'We have done this historically through our work and will continue to do so in the future<br>' Ashton continued: 'A couple months ago, Dannys family reached out to us and they asked us to write character letters to represent the person that we knew for 25 years so that the judge could take that into full consideration relative to the sentencing<br>' Mila went on to say: 'The letters were not written to question the legitimacy of the judicial system or the validity of the jurys ruling<br>' 'They were intended for the judge to read<br> And not to undermine the testimonies of the victims or re-traumatize them in any way<br> 'We would never want to do that<br> And we are sorry if that has taken place,' Ashton emphasized<br> 'Our heart goes out to every single person that has ever been a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse or rape,' Mila said to conclude their statement<br> Their friend: After he was found guilty of raping two women, the Hollywood A-listers pleaded for lenience The comments on the post were disabled<br> Ali reposted the video, saying: 'Its important to note that the letters werent just character letters youd write for a friend<br> The letters, which contained a great deal of Scientological phrasing, were intended to undermine the victims who were drugged by Danny<br>' Masterson was handed a 30 years to life sentence earlier this week after a jury found him guilty of raping two women in the early 2000s<br> Since the actors' letters were released, fans have reacted with outrage online<br> One former supporter wrote on a recent Instagram post of Kutcher's, 'Im not a fan of cancel culture, but I make an exception for you two<br>' Someone else added, 'Hard f*****g pass on you two<br> How the mighty have fallen<br>' Slammed: Journalist Yashar Ali wrote on X/Twitter, 'Its important to note that the letters werent just character letters youd write for a friend<br> The letters, which contained a great deal of Scientological phrasing, were intended to undermine the victims who were drugged by Danny' Hot take: One fan noted that their brief video seemed like a 'hostage video' Disappointed: A dismayed fan asked, 'WTF is wrong with you?' and received thousands of likes Choice words: The comments on the video were turned off, but fans flocked to one of Kutcher's recent social media posts to leave their thoughts Their defense: 'We support victims,' Mila said in the video, adding, 'We have done this historically through our work and will continue to do so in the future' The couple supported their former That 70s Show castmate by making individual submissions to the court, despite him already being convicted for raping two women<br> In the letters obtained by DailyMail<br>com, both Kunis and Kutcher - who is credited as a co-founder and board chair of a non-profit purported to help fight child sex exploitation - spoke highly of Masterson, claiming he always 'treated people with decency, equality, and generosity<br>' In his letter to the judge, Kutcher wrote: 'He's an extraordinarily honest and intentional human being<br> 'Over our 25-year relationship I don't recall him ever lying to me<br> He's taught me about being direct and confronting issues in life and relationships head-on, resolving them, and moving forward<br>' Share or comment on this article: Danny Masterson victim slams Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis' 'insulting and hurtful' video apologizing
