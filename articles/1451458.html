                The visitors secured a historic win the first leg of their tour taking the T20 series at Derby on Thursday Chamari Athapaththu took three wickets for 21 runs as England were all out for 116 and the captain went on to smash 44 to steer her side to a 21 series victory The win was Sri Lankas firstever whiteball series win against England and Beaumont admitted it was a tough series for her teammates It was a tough series for the girls probably not what they were expecting Beaumont told Sky Sports News All credit to Sri Lanka they have come over and played really well so far The young players in the squad will certainly learn a lot and hopefully learn quickly and take it into tomorrows game Having not featured in the T20s opener Beaumont makes her return to the ODI squad ahead of the first 50over clash taking place at the Seat Unique Riverside in ChesterleStreet on Saturday before games taking place at Northampton and Leicester next week The T20 contests saw plenty of new faces given an opportunity to play including Mahika Gaur and Maia Bouchier something which England coach Jon Lewis described as a valuable exercise Beaumonts return to the squad comes off the back of a successful Ashes where she scored a double ton in the Test match before contributing with the bat in the ODIs The upcoming series sees experienced head Nat SciverBrunt return to the fold and Beaumont hopes experience will help England during the 50over games We have got myself Emma Lamb and Nat SciverBrunt coming back into the squad she added We are just desperate to bring a lot of energy to the group and hopefully some experience with myself and Nat in particular We want to get back to winning ways quickly and hopefully have a successful series against Sri Lanka
