                On the back of the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UKs manufacturing output soared to 224 billion last year, according to the , Wednesday, September 13. Booming Manufacturing Sector Despite the broader economy showing only slight growth, a fresh report released today by Make UK highlights a flourishing goods production sector. In the 1970s, products like British cars, aircraft, and chemicals made up a quarter of the GDP. However, the subsequent move towards services saw this contribution dip below ten per cent. Most Read on Euro Weekly News Make UK believes that if the government sticks to its aim of contributing 15 per cent of GDP, it could inject an extra 142 billion into the British economy. This would surpass any potential gains from post-Brexit trade deals currently under discussion. UK Climbs The Global Ranks The robust performance of the sector has propelled the UK past France, making it the worlds eighth-largest manufacturer, based on the most recent global data. In 2021, the UKs manufacturing output was 218 billion, trailing Italys 252 billion but surpassing Frances 210 billion. However, Make UK warns that while this rise in rankings is encouraging, its only the third time in 20 years that the UK has outperformed its French counterpart. The Impact On Jobs And Trade Representing 20,000 manufacturers nationwide, Make UK states that the sector now underpins 2.6 million jobs. On average, these roles offer salaries that are nine per cent higher than the national average. The mean yearly gross pay stands at 36,488, compared to 33,402 overall, and 32,676 in the services sector. from the UK have also seen a boost. Exports surged by 19.5 per cent in the year leading up to June, while imports increased by 11.7 per cent. Consequently, the total trade value has reached a record-breaking figure of nearly 1.75 trillion. The car industry played a significant role in the UKs 0.2 per cent economic growth in the last quarter. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) projects that car production in the UK will exceed last years figures by 100,000 units. Yet, data from the Department for Business and Trade reveals that cars rank third in the UKs export value hierarchy. The top spot is occupied by unspecified goods, which encompasses non-monetary gold, precious metals, and notably, defence equipment. These goods accounted for exports worth 43.7 billion in the past year, followed by 32.2 billion from mechanical power generators and 28.8 billion from cars. Make UK reiterates its plea for the government to devise a long-term strategy. They aim to realise the ambition of manufacturing making up 15 per cent of GDP, with hopes of surpassing Italy in global rankings. Thank you for taking the time to read this article.
