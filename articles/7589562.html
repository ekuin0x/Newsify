                The was announced on September 12 at Apples . Available in four sizes, Cupertino revamped the standard models while taking the Pro iPhones to the next level. Heres what you need to know about these new phones. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the Design: The Dynamic Island welcomes more people After ditching the classic iPhone X notch in 2022 for the iPhone 14 Pro models, Apple has expanded the new to all iPhone 15 versions. All four new iPhones offer this new design in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays. For the regular models, Apple has increased its brightness to 2,000 nits outdoors  twice as much as the previous generation. The back glass is strengthened with an optimized dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a textured matte finish. A new contoured edge on the aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure wants to make this iPhone feel nicer in users hands. Apple added an for the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max while maintaining the same 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays. By adding a titanium design, which is the same used in spacecraft, Apple says it offers one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this the companys lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new brush texture and contoured edges. The Pro lineup combines the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with strength through solid-state diffusion. According to Apple, the aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience. Another change with the iPhone 15 Pro models is the all-new Action button, which replaces the single-function mute switch. Users can now activate with it, such as: Apple says that color is infused throughout the back glass for the first time in a smartphone, creating five colors for the iPhone 15 models. These are the : For the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max models, Apple has ditched gold for the first time in favor of these colors: A16 Bionic and A17 Pro power this new generation For these new iPhones, Apple is following the same strategy as the iPhone 14 lineup: adding a new chip to the Pro iPhones and using last years processor to the base-model options. That said, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus offer the iPhone 14 Pros A16 Bionic chip. With two high-performance cores that use 20 percent less power and four high-efficiency cores, the 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and handles intensive tasks while saving battery life. The 5-core GPU has 50 percent more memory bandwidth for smooth graphics when streaming videos and playing games. A new 16-core Neural Engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features like Live Voicemail transcriptions in iOS 17 and third-party app experiences  all while protecting critical privacy and security features using the Secure Enclave. s A17 Pro chip is the industrys first 3-nanometer chip. The new CPU is up to 10 percent faster with microarchitectural and design improvements, and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17. The pro-class GPU is up to 20 percent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency. Now, hardware-accelerated ray tracing is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing. Apple even promotes new console titles for this iPhone, such as Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, and Assassins Creed Mirage. These are the storage capacities for all four new models: Cameras: From iPhone 15 to iPhone 15 Pro Max For the first time, Apple added a 48MP main lens to the standard iPhones, which helps the device absorb more light in photos. With the quad-pixel tech, the image output will still be 12 Megapixels, but theyll be clearer and crispier. Apple uses Photonic Engine to deliver richer details. This 48MP provides 2x optical zoom. That said, even though Apple didnt add a telephoto camera, you can zoom without losing quality on the standard iPhone model. For the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple has upgraded the 48MP main camera by giving users the flexibility of using the new 24MP super-high-resolution default. The main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths  24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm  and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the main camera supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on an iPhone: 5x at 120 mm. The new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apples most advanced stabilization system yet. All four iPhone 15 models offer some similar camera capabilities. Here they are: New Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. It gets better with sharper details and more vivid colors, now powered by the Photonic Engine. iPhone 15 Pro models get improved Night mode portraits thanks to the LiDAR scanner. For the first time, users can take portraits without switching to Portrait mode. When a person, dog, or cat is in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information so that users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after taking the photo. After Apple announced its , wrote that it would be possible for a new iPhone to feature Spatial Video. This function lets you record 3D videos, which will be perfect to watch on the Vision Pro headset. During its Wonderlust event, Apple announced that the iPhone 15 Pro is the first device to record Spatial Video for Apple Vision Pro. Users can capture precious moments in three dimensions and relive those memories with incredible depth on the companys spatial computer when available early next year in the US. USB-C, U2 chip, and Roadside Assistance via satellite All four iPhone 15 models ditched the Lightning port . While the regular models get USB-C 2.0, the Pro versions get USB-C 3.0 standards, which gives transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second, up to 20x faster than before. That said, users must buy a new cable, which is not the braided one available in the box of this iPhone, to get these transfer speeds. In addition, these phones also have a new ultrawide-band chip called U2. It connects to a device three times farther, unlocking the ability to use Precision Find to find friends in a crowd, for example. Finally, Apple is adding a new peace of mind feature called Roadside Assistance via satellite, and it joins the current Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection. With this new function, when users have car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are unavailable, they can now connect to AAA, the countrys largest roadside assistance provider. An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership but is also available separately for nonmembers. iOS 17 will power this iPhone Previewed during the WWDC 2023 keynote, the new iPhone 15 models feature iOS 17, releasing on September 18. This operating system is bringing updates to the Contacts app, FaceTime, while introducing new experiences with a Journal app, mental health awareness focuses, and privacy features, such as removing URL trackers on Safari, adding profiles for Safari usage, and more. Release date All four iPhone 15 models will be on September 22. Customers in more than 40 countries and regions, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the UAE, the UK, and the US, can pre-order iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro beginning at 5 a.m. PDT. iPhone 15 Price Apple also .
