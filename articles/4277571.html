                The village of Andriivka  about six miles south of the Russia-occupied town of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region  is the latest gain for Kyiv in a counter-offensive that has seen slow but steady gains by Ukrainian forces. The announcement of reclaiming Andriivka came early on Friday from the General Staff of Ukraines armed forces. Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine  15 September 2023. Find out more about Defence Intelligence's use of language:    Ministry of Defence  (@DefenceHQ) The 3rd Assault Brigade said it captured the village after surrounding the Russian garrison in Andriivka in what it described as a lightning operation and destroying it over two days. It described the capture of Andriivka as a breakthrough on the southern flank of Bakhmut and key to success in all further directions. Just hours before confirming the capture of Andriivka early on Friday, the brigade contested a statement by Ukraines deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar saying the village was reclaimed. The fighting in and around Bakhmut, a salt-mining town now in complete ruins, marked the wars longest and bloodiest engagement. Today, there are reasons to praise the work of Ukraines Security Service, its personnel, and the Ukrainian Navy. I thank them for todays triumphdestroying the occupants air defense system in our Crimea. Very significant outcome! Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine!  Volodymyr Zelenskyy /   (@ZelenskyyUa) After Russian forces led by the Wagner Group military contractor captured Bakhmut in May, Ukrainian forces sought to envelop it from the south and the north, gaining ground yard by yard in the past three months. Andriivka is located between the settlements of Kurdiumivka and the heights of Klischiivka in the Donetsk region, where fighting has been especially intense. Ukraines General Staff said Ukrainian forces also inflicted heavy losses on Russian troops as part of its offensive in nearby Klishchiivka village. Ms Maliar said that Ukraine had regained 19 square miles of land around Bakhmut since the start of the counter-offensive in June.
