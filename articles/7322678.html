                The latest series of Married at First Sight hasn't even begun yet  but that hasn't stopped groom Nathanial Valentino from wedging his foot into his mouth. The former reality TV star, who appeared in Geordie Shore, agreed to wed a stranger when the E4 series returns this month. But things are not looking good for his new bride, as he is busy posting loved-up snaps of himself in Mykonos with new girlfriend Erin Daniels on Instagram . And to add insult to injury, he still has a snap of his TV wedding pinned on his Instagram page, which he describes as: 'M A G I C A L." A show spokesman last night insisted Erin was "just a friend." But a source said: "This is pretty embarrassing for E4, as people tune into the show to see how these marriages are going to work out. Nathanial is not likely to be flavour of the month there at the moment." Ahead of his appearance on the E4 show, Nathanial shared how he gets to enjoy a jet-set lifestyle. European Christmas Market breaks cut to just 79 in massive sale New contestant Nathanial was pictured with another woman ( Image: Channel 4) The latest series of Married at First Sight UK returns this month ( Image: Matt Monfredi / Channel 4) He confessed that he is on the search for love and is hoping to find someone who is open-minded. It isn't Nathanial's first taste of reality TV, with the 36-year-old appearing on Geordie Shore: Hot Single Summer in 2021. Married at First Sight is used to its fair share of drama from dinner party arguments, cheating scandals and caustic put downs that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Last year, one of the biggest scandals was when Whitney Hughes jumped ship with her fellow Married At First Sight participant Matt Murray. Both Whitney and Matt had exchanged vows with other people but it was while they were away on a couple bonding retreat that sparks started to fly. Sneaking off, viewers saw them kiss for the first time before publicly admitting that they had fallen for each other. And they were allowed to stay in the experiment as a newly formed couple  leaving viewers outraged by the decision. But their relationship didn't stand the test of time after the show. Since the show wrapped, Matt's partnered wife Gemma took to social media to share her reactions to the scenes of her ex-husband and Whitney and give further insight to viewers of the programme. She claimed she and Matt made up after filming wrapped but fell out again  with her accusing him of gaslighting. However, Matt denied the claims as he told the Mirror: "Gemma did reach out to me and we both cleared the air. The rest of the accusations made are false and are becoming very distressing for me." While Gemma posted an update: "I just wanted to hop and say that I did clear the air with Matt  I actually reached out to him. I didn't want to leave it the way it... it got very nasty, which you'll see at the end. And then he started gaslighting me again. He started saying: 'You need to worry about what people are gonna say about you' and, you know 'what people's opinions are gonna be afterwards' so I blocked him. OK, I blocked him."
