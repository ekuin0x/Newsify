                A BBC investigation suggests that the company illegally discharged sewage for hundreds of hours last year, on days when it was not raining. The investigation alleges that Southern Water, along with Thames Water and Wessex Water, breached their permits by discharging raw sewage into waterways on days that there was no rainfall, called dry spilling. It is illegal, as without the rainfall, there is less water to dilute the sewage. Geoff Cooper, Lib Dem Parliamentary Spokesperson for Romsey and Southampton, said: This latest scandal to hit Southern Water must be investigated and if found to be true, then the government should have no choice but to revoke Southern Waters licence. According to the BBC, Southern Water released raw sewage for a total 792 hours across 63 separate dry spills including on July 19 2022 which was the hottest day on record for the UK, as temperatures hit 40C. Mr Cooper added: It astonishes me that Southern Water still have their licence. The company has persistently polluted our rivers and failed to invest in the infrastructure needed to guarantee fresh water supply to residents for years. Our residents and environment are suffering at the hands of a water company which has the sole objective of making profit. It is time the regulators forced these companies to put the environment before profit and operate as public benefit companies similar to what we see being done in the United States. If the BBCs investigation is proven to be true, I cannot see how the government can allow Southern Water to continue to operate. It is time this cowboy company and others like it were brought to heel by the government and OFWAT. John Penicud, head of wastewater at Southern Water said: So-called dry spills are a complex issue. Water is a powerful force of nature  and high groundwater conditions can lead to rising water finding the path of least resistance into a network of sewer pipes and manholes, and a discharge made up of groundwater is not caused by rainfall and can happen in dry weather. It is required to be reported as a spill. The problem is especially challenging in areas prone to flooding, as mitigation measures such as sewer relining and manhole sealing redirect flows and groundwater can then cause flooding. Private, illegal connections to the system are another potential source. We work with the Environment Agency and stakeholders to cut these so-called dry spills  and all forms of water and wastewater releases.
