At the forefront of many people's minds is the autumn coat, and a has been impressing the store's fans. The comes in two stunning colours: black and Khaki. It features long sleeves, pockets, a zip fastening and zipper details to the arms. It's the perfect coat to wear over a jumper but can also be paired with a dress for more formal occasions. Primark's website says: "This jacket seamlessly combines a fashion-forward aesthetic with practical functionality, making it a must-have addition to your wardrobe. While the relaxed silhouette flatters all body types, it also allows for easy layering, making it suitable for all weather conditions. "Pair it with jeans and a hoody for a relaxed vibe, or dress it up with a top, tailored trousers and heels for a more polished ensemble. So, stay ahead of the latest trends and experience the confidence and versatility this jacket brings to your wardrobe!" Fans were very impressed after the chain shared a video of the item on Instagram. One follower said: "The boots an jacket must-haves, who'd have thought these jackets would make a come back?" Another wrote: "Its giving Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman vibes." A third penned: "Amazing, ready for a night out" And for customers on the hunt for winter coats, Marks and Spencer's is also selling an impressive which Hollywood actress says is her favourite item. It comes with flap pockets, buttoned cuffs and smart finishing touches. Speaking to M&S, she said: My favourite item from the Autumn by M&S collection is the tweed blazer because I feel like you can dress it up and down. "Its beautifully tailored and a classic. I have lots of style icons, but I think Jane Birkin always looked beautiful and relaxed. Whenever Im at a loss for what to wear, I opt for her uniform of jeans and a perfect T-shirt and a nice bag. "My always-on items are sunglasses, a crisp white shirt, a blazer and flats. However, footwear is obviously mood dependent.
