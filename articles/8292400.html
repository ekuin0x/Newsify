Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Feeling bored, lack of motivation or exhausted at work? The end-of-summer blahs can stifle your ... [+] productivity, but there are steps you can take to energize your job. getty The end of summer, marked by shortening days and back-to-office mandates , might have an already burnt-out workforce suffering a bit of malaise. Productivity drops by 20% during summer, over half feel distracted and many struggle with post-vacation blues once theyre back at work. Not to mention the onset of the winter blues and seasonal affective disorder for some workers. Its no wonder that boosting productivity is a top priority in early fall. Google searches for ways to be more productive and productivity hacks have increased by +356% and +115% respectively this month. And if youre a job seeker, you want to gear up for the September Surge the post-Labor Day hiring increase, where job opportunities suddenly become abundant after the holiday. What Are The End-Of-Summer Blues? Although its commonly believed that employees emerge from the summer season feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, the truth is that many workers return from the Labor Day holiday still feeling the strain of burnout, according to Sarah Whitman, senior vice president of E-comm at Workhuman . Whether you call it the end of summer blues or the seasonal scaries, there is a sense of malaise and anxiety that tends to hang over workers as the summer comes to an end, kids go back to school and the days start getting noticeably shorter, she notes. The change of season signals the end of trends like Summer Fridays and begins a renewed push for workers to return to the office full-time, which can create negative feelings related to change. Theres a sense of anticipation and worry that all the fun is over, and there are only challenges aheadits almost like those back-to-school blues that came up when we were kids. Factor in the ongoing economic uncertainty and its impact, and these feelings are going to be deeply detrimental to the employees mental health, leading to adverse effects on engagement and productivity at work. In fact, in our research with Gallup, Workhuman found that burnout-related turnover alone can cost companies 15% to 20% of payroll. However, Whitman insists it doesnt have to be this way. When people know they are returning to a workplace where they are supported and appreciated, the anxiety wont press so heavily on their shoulders, she says. The end-of-summer blues are lessened, and people return from their vacations and long weekends with energy and ambition. This is why recognition is so important. In that same report with Gallup, we found that employees who believe recognition is an important part of their culture are up to 91% more likely to thrive at work. Those who are not just survivingbut thriving are more productive and make greater contributions to the business. Tips To Boost Team Productivity Viktor Grekov, founder of Oboard , shared five tips with me on how to avoid the post-summer slump and get motivated again. Refresh your goals and bring minds back into the office. Before you get stuck in that backlog of emails, take a moment to remind your team of the long-term goal and how you intend to achieve it. Q3, as the summer season comes to an end, is the perfect time to check on your progress. Its far better to identify issues now than in December. Reflect on what has been accomplished, evaluate progress, and make sure every team member understands their priorities, deadlines and expectations. Likewise, set a key focus for the post-holiday period centered around the most critical projects that require attention. This will prevent scattered efforts and keep everyone on track as you work towards your goalsas a team, not as individuals. Involve the entire team in every goal-setting decision . You may need to set a new course, but demanding your team to drop their work and give up on all that progress is a surefire way to tank motivation at a time when productivity is already down. Involve them in goal-setting, be honest, encourage opinions and invite them to share their issues. With 69% of employees stating they work harder when they feel appreciated, this will keep morale high as team members ease back into their work routine. Cancel those back-to-back-to-back meetings. You may think more meetings are the best way to bring minds back from the beach. Yet, research shows that inefficient meetings and having too many of them are the workplaces two biggest productivity drains. In fact, thats one of the reasons why the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework gained such popularity, as it helps reduce those pesky time-drainers. If focus is constantly disrupted, you can wave goodbye to any progressespecially if workers feel like their presence isnt even noticed. What your team needs is flow time, designated blocks of uninterrupted time during which they can focus solely on their to-do list. No meetings, no emails and no distractions, allowing productivity to flow. If a meeting is truly necessary, let team members take turns leading. Not only does this distribute the workload, but it also encourages diverse perspectives and builds leadership skills throughout the team. Visualize your goals and progress. Getting buried under an avalanche of tasks is easyand not at all motivating. To feel fulfilled in our jobs, we need to see the progress were making and how it contributes to the companys overall success. We dont want to be a cog in the machine. We want to know that were genuinely making a difference. Shown to increase workplace efficiency by 78%, OKRs (when linked to our daily tasks and constantly updated to reflect progress) are a great way to do this. However, if you dont have them in place, you can also encourage mind mapping, which involves visualizing priorities, goals, and tasksand how our work contributes to the teams overall goal. This can help team members to see the bigger picture and identify the crucial role they play. Set time aside to learn and talk . Optimal productivity is a fine balance between work and play. In between strenuous bursts of hard work, encourage team members to engage in short, focused learning sessions such as watching a TED Talk, reading an insightful article or trying out a new productivity-boosting technique. Socialization is important too. You should pair up team members for peer coaching sessions, where each person discusses their struggles and their partner suggests potential solutions. This fosters a supportive environment where problem-solving and skill enhancement are simply part of the job, sparking fresh ideas and perspectives and boosting productivity and motivation.

She told me that Workhumans recognition platform is one way to combat the end-of-summer blues in which employees turn recognition points they receive from colleagues into a wide range of items from the Workhuman Storelike that new pair of sunglasses or taking their family out to dinner. Weve seen people book photo shoots at the Eiffel Tower, zipline adventures through the rain forest and five-course dinners in Pragueall once-in-a-lifetime adventures, she notes. Employees return from their time off with these incredible memories, and they also have that connection with the colleagues who helped them earn that experience. Follow me on Twitter .
