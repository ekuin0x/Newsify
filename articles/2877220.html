                The rookie wide receiver had five touches on Sunday and three of them went for 60 (and a touchdown), 54 and 45. The first two came on deep passes from Russell Wilson and the third on a punt return. Hes the first Broncos player since the AFL/NFL merger with multiple 50-plus yard catches in a single game and the eighth NFL rookie with three or more plays of 45-plus yards in a game since 1998. Perhaps hell play more than 16 snaps in Week 3. Jonathon Cooper and Nik Bonitto combined for three sacks and three tackles for loss against Washington. Both showed promise during camp and in the preseason, but you never know exactly how it will translate. Bonitto is learning how to use his speed and bend against NFL tackles, but still has work to do in run support. Denvers OLB group looks well positioned to absorb the loss of Frank Clark to injury and continue producing until Baron Browning returns. Yeah, . But Johnson scored touchdowns on both of his catches Sunday and only saw his playing time tick down marginally (50% of Week 1 snaps to 45% in Week 2) despite Jerry Jeudys return. Johnson has size and speed and is a nice role player in a receiving corps that has a chance to be pretty good if it stays healthy. The acceleration he showed to turn a crossing route into a 16-yard touchdown is indicative of what he can do with a little bit of space. the Broncos chances at the top overall pick jumped from 1.2% after Week 1 to 4.4% after Week 2 (ninth highest in the NFL). Such is life for a team that opens the season with back-to-back home losses. The Broncos, of course, will hope for a turnaround on the field despite spending the next two weeks on the road. In the meantime, though, its not ideal that, are almost identical to the odds 0-2 teams face making the playoffs (4.3%) over the past three seasons since the postseason expanded to 14 teams. Pick pretty much any metric and the Broncos defense fared poorly Sunday. Washington had 399 offensive yards and 26 first downs en route to 33 minutes, 45 seconds of possession. The Commanders scored touchdowns on all three red zone trips. The Broncos didnt force a turnover. They sacked Sam Howell four times but also got caught with their ears pinned back on four screen passes for 87 yards. The tackling, particularly in the second half, was brutal. For a group that was supposed to be the one that hit the ground running this offseason, its been an underwhelming start. Theyll have to get it together fast and that starts with the veteran defensive coordinator back for a second stint with the Broncos. McGlincheys brought leadership to the Broncos and hes had tough assignments the first two weeks in Las Vegas Maxx Crosby and Washingtons bevy of talented rushers. But he allowed too much pressure on Wilson Sunday against the Commanders. The most glaring: that led to a sack and immediately knocked Denvers opening drive off the rails. It was the first of five second-half sacks for Washington. The Broncos veteran safety is off to a rough start this year. Hes concussed an opposing player with a high hit in each of Denvers first two games, been penalized for both and was ejected Sunday. Its possible hell be suspended for Week 3 and Washington players understandably took issue with his hit on Logan Thomas in the end zone and opposing teams from here out will keep a close eye on Jackson. Fourteen years of physical NFL service buys some benefit of the doubt and Jackson apologized last week, but this cant be a continuing theme. Running back Javonte Williams churned to 24 yards on his opening two carries. The Broncos at halftime had 12 carries for 71 yards (5.9 per carry) and a 10-point lead. And yet in the second half the Broncos ran the ball just 11 times, including four from Wilson. Game flows vary week to week, but jumping out to a 21-3 lead and finishing with 14 combined carries for your running backs is an odd way of showing youre committed to relying on your run game.
