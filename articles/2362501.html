The Health Minister said that UHS had made immaculate arrangements for the MDCAT. All the candidates and their parents have been provided a comfortable environment, Prof. Javed Akram said adding that the exam started on time and would end on time. He further said that MDCAT was a tough competition and every effort had been made to uphold merit and transparency. Responding to a question, the provincial minister said the cost for conducting MDCAT was more than the money received by UHS for the purpose, so the Punjab Cabinet had approved an additional grant of Rs 1,000 per candidate for the university. UHS VC, Prof. Ahsan Waheed Rathore, said that the conduct of MDCAT was important as it would ensure merit and justice. He further said that new standard operating procedures were developed and fresh multi-tiered security measures were taken for every step of preparation, printing, packaging, and transportation of MDCAT paper. Prof. Rathore said that medical and dental colleges have always challenged the brightest and best-prepared minds. He added that admissions were consistently becoming more competitive. MDCAT results are extremely important. They carry 50 percent weightage in merit as per the formula of the Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PM&DC). They are proof that the candidate can handle the academic rigors of medical or dental college. He thanked the Punjab government for its support in the smooth conduct of the test. Later in the evening, just five hours after the test, UHS uploaded the answer key to the question paper on its website. With the help of this key, candidates can calculate their scores themselves. The official result will be declared in a week after which the admission schedule will be announced. There are 3376 MBBS seats in 16 public sector medical colleges and 240 BDS seats in 03 public dental colleges of Punjab. Besides, there are around 4500 MBBS and 800 BDS seats in 45 private sector medical and dental colleges of the province. Copyright Business Recorder, 2023
