                Kylie Jenner and her new love interest Timothee Chalamet are said to be 'very different' from each other as they go public to the world with their 'contrived' relationship, according to a body language expert Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet aren't two celebrities you'd necessarily pair up and put in a romantic relationship if you were a matchmaker, but they certainly seem smitten nonetheless. But although they seem loved up, an expert has said that their relationship looks "contrived". Speculation has been rife of late that reality star Kylie, 26, and Hollywood actor Timothee, 27, are dating. And just mere days ago the couple seemingly confirmed their relationship when they were photographed kissing at a Beyonce concert in Los Angeles as they couldn't keep their hands off one another. And then yesterday things heated up a tad more when the couple displayed their new romance all over again, but this time at the Men's Singles Final at the US Open in New York. Sharing a steamy smooch in view of the world, the couple puckered up while Novak Djokovic achieved his record-breaking 24th Grand Slam title against Russia's Daniil ( Image: Corey Sipkin/UPI/REX/Shutterstock)
