                There were plenty of reasons to be annoyed during Irelands 20 loss to France Lack of possession no cutting edge and some sloppy defending Ireland never really laid a glove on their opponents in Paris last night To make matters even worse RTE viewers were subjected to an extremely irritating commentary gaffe that left Irish fans raging READ MORE Irish fans taunt France with Messi chants during 20 loss in Paris While the game was being broadcast on TV with Des Curran and Ray Houghton providing commentary viewers were also able to hear RTE radio commentators John Fallon and Kenny Cunningham in the background This meant that watchers were essentially hearing the same commentary twice while watching the game Understandably this didnt sit well with fans who took to social media to voice their displeasure Radio commentary at times coming through on rte Tv Who said RTE dont give value for money Watching the game on RTE2  we can listen to RTE 2fm radio commentary in the background RTE making a balls of the commentary by adding the radio one as well Clueless clowns Can hear the RTE radio commentary in the background of the TV commentaryah RTE and sound problems We have a couple of commentary teams on Rte Bit of a battle of the bands on RTE tv commentary with JohnKennyMedia on the radio coming in loud and clear Thankfully the issue was addressed after a few minutes and there were no problems for the rest of the game This isnt the first time RTE have had sound issues and the National broadcaster famously had an audio disaster during Irelands World Cup clash with Australia in July Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts
