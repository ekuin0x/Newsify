But in light of the economic pullback were experiencing, its essential not to waste a single drop of effort, budget or opportunity. Yet, companies have wasted about $2 trillion per year through inefficiencies, redundancies and misplaced priorities. As B2B sales and marketing teams are being tasked with doing more with less, I want to share a framework to better ensure you can get the most from every dollar and every ounce of effort you expend. Five Steps To Ensure Efficiency Ive long been an advocate of what I call the five-step play. But even on my team, we got a little lax about following this plan in the past couple of years. Not anymore. Weve recommitted to following the five-step play for every marketing initiative, and I believe that the resultsboth in terms of better business outcomes and less burnout due to wasted effortsare well worth it. Heres a breakdown of how the five-step play works. Step 0: Define your business objective.

This is essential, since without a clear and compelling business objective, theres no justification for launching a play to begin with. Plus, getting clear on your business objective will inform each of the five steps. Step 1: Select the best accounts. Based on the business objective, you need to select the right accounts to target. Selecting the best accounts means understanding who you can successfully sell tothe ones that fit your ideal customer profile (ICP) and are in-market (most likely to buy). You can determine this based on intelligence that compares current prospect behavior to the behavior of accounts youve previously won. Selecting the best accounts is a great pressure test for any campaign because it tells you whether there are enough accounts to achieve your business objective. It also ensures youre hitting the right accounts and contacts and not wasting resources on accounts that dont fit your ICP or arent in-market to buy. Step 2: Know about them. Now that youve selected the best accounts to target, you need to know about them. This is critical because in order to engage, you need to be relevant. And its impossible to be relevant without knowing a lot about your audience. For this step, you need to amass deep insightsbeyond accounts industry, number of employees, annual revenue, etc. Youll want to understand their tech stack, whos on the buying committee, what theyre researching and where they are in their buying journey. If youre running a persona-based campaign, you need to know what keywords those personas are researching and what content they consume. These insights allow you to shape the messaging for the campaign thats relevant to the accounts and contacts youre targeting. Step 3: Engage the right way. Only now can you create compelling, personalized content delivered over the right channels at the right time. Whether its display, website experience, direct mail or BDR cadences, everything needs to be personalized by account, persona and timing. This kind of engagement requires predictive analytics to understand where accounts are in the buying journey and what they care about. Orchestration is key to providing a top-notch, personalized experience across tactics and channels with the same relevant message. Step 4: Collaborate with sales. Its a tale as old as timemarketing pours resources into campaigns to drum up demand and sales doesnt follow up. Or sales receives a list of leads from marketing that turns out to be nothing but duds. The five-step play strategy helps put an end to that. Collaborating with sales means sharing the same set of data, being aligned on goals and priorities, and knowing when sellers should engage with accounts for maximum success (and having that outlined in a well-defined SLA). If youre using spreadsheets, weekly calls, handoff processes or outdated information, youre likely not going to have real collaboration. The same is true if you have multiple systems to track, report, and manage your sales and marketing efforts. Its essential to share a dashboard where everyone can see marketings activities, accounts readiness and sales outreach. This way, regardless of what the campaign is, sellers are alerted at the exact right time to reach out, and theyre armed with all those insights we talked about earlier so all their communication is relevant. Step 5: Track real stuff. And finally, my favorite part. Im a recovering software saleswoman, where quotas made it crystal clear whether we were hitting our goals or not. When I moved to marketing, no one could tell whether we were doing well or not. Thats because it was the norm to use vague metrics like marketing qualified leads (MQLs) to gauge success. The role of marketing is to future-proof revenue, so it made sense to me that we should have a solid pipeline quota. This means that when planning a campaign, the success metrics are tied to your pipeline. Depending on your business objective, you may want to track metrics like new accounts engaged, new personas engaged, accounts progressing through the buying cycle, opportunity rate or account win rates, among others. An Orchestrated Path Forward These five steps toward account engagement can transform the way you do business. When you are clear on your business objective, select the best accounts, know about them, engage the right way, collaborate with sales and track real stuff, you can better eliminate waste. Thats best practice in any economic environment, but these days its absolutely critical.
