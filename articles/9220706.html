                NEW YORK  The Nun 2 and A Haunting in Venice virtually tied for the No. 1 spot in U.S. and Canadian theaters over the weekend, with a slight edge carrying the horror sequel over the Hercule Poirot mystery, according to studio estimates Sunday. In its second weekend of release, Warner Bros. The Nun 2, a spinoff from the studios lucrative Conjuring franchise, grossed $14.7 million. If numbers hold, that will give The Nun 2 (up to $56.5 million total and $158.8 million worldwide) the top spot at the box office for the second straight week. Advertisement Very close behind was A Haunting in Venice, Kenneth Branaghs third Agatha Christie adaptation following 2017s Murder on the Orient Express and 2022s Death on the Nile. It opened with $14.5 million. Final box-office figures will be released Monday. Advertisement After the successful run of Murder on the Orient Express ($352.8 million worldwide against a production budget of $55 million) and the less-stellar global haul of Death on the Nile ($137.3 million against a $90 million budget), the sluggish start for A Haunting in Venice may have signaled the death knell for Branaghs detective. The 20th Century Studios film, released by the Walt Disney Co., grossed $22.7 million internationally. And it cost less than its predecessor, carrying a production budget of about $60 million. The Equalizer 3, starring Denzel Washington, dropped to third place with $7.2 million. In three weeks, its grossed $73.7 million domestically and $132.4 million worldwide. Fourth place went to My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 with $4.7 million in its second weekend of release. Its grossed $18.5 million domestically. It was one of the quietest weekend in movie theaters this year, as Hollywood  which has spent much of the last two weeks promoting its films at the Venice, Telluride and Toronto film festivals  treads water in between the summer smashes of Barbie and Oppenheimer and awaits its top fall movies. Some of those, like Dune: Part Two, have already postponed until next year due to the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes. One anticipated fall film, Sonys Dumb Money, opted for a platform release, debuting in eight theaters over the weekend before expanding next weekend and going wide Sept. 29. The film, a rollicking dramatization of the GameStop stock frenzy, grossed $217,000, for a per-location average of about $27,000. And Barbie also remains in the picture. For the ninth straight weekend, Greta Gerwigs box-office sensation ranked in the top five films. It added $4 million to bring its domestic total to $625 million and its global haul to $1.42 billion. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer has reached $912.7 million, making it the highest grossing biopic ever, passing Bohemian Rhapsody. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. The Nun II, $14.7 million. Advertisement 2.
