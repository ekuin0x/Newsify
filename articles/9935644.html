                England did not contest Currys dismissal for a dangerous tackle in Saturdays 14-man demolition of Argentina when the Sale openside appeared before a brief virtual hearing on Tuesday. After the disruption caused to their World Cup preparations by the Owen Farrell and Billy Vunipola incidents last month, England are keen to focus all their attention on Sundays Pool D showdown with Japan. And while continuing to hone their tackle technique in training, defence coach Sinfield is satisfied there is no deep-rooted problem. Discipline-wise, we gave away seven penalties at the weekend, Sinfield said. I dont think weve got a discipline problem, I thought it was really unfortunate what happened at the weekend. Its been different from the other challenges that have taken place. We continue to work on our tackle skill  and work incredibly hard. The guys have bought into it and have done so for some time, but theyre human and they make mistakes. Weve got to understand that. And unfortunately weve had to deal with four red cards in six games. Were getting pretty good at defending with 14 men, but we want to have our full complement on the field for as long as possible at all times. So we hope to improve that area, but its tricky to pinpoint exactly what that is. Well spend time with Tom and put him through tackle school and work incredibly hard with him again. Well get him right for a couple of weeks time. Observers have been left scratching their heads by the inconsistent refereeing evident during the opening round of World Cup matches. While Curry was given his marching orders for his third-minute clash of heads with Juan Cruz Mallia, similar incidents involving players from South Africa and Chile went unpunished. On this occasion England could be justified for nursing a sense of grievance at the way the cards have fallen against them and Sinfield admits the disparity between decisions makes a players job harder. I think it makes life really difficult for the players, first and foremost, and thats what were all here for, Sinfield said. We all want to see the players out on the field, we want to see the best players in the world go head to head. Weve just got to be careful.     |  England Rugby (@EnglandRugby) We control what we can control. Were in full support of the rules and regulations. We try and train as hard as we can, but within the laws of the game and well continued to do that. England name their team to face Japan on Friday night and Sinfield insists there will be no room for sentimentality when making any tight calls. At the top of the list is to win the game to we pick the team that we think gives us the best chance of winning, Sinfield said. Within that theres always a balance, but were in a World Cup and were not here to give people game-time, were here to win games. Were not here to give Test shirts out because someone deserves one, were here because we have to win games.
