                Mother-of-three Dani Dyer cuts a sporty figure in colourful gymwear as she heads home with a pal after a gruelling workout By Kirsten Murray For Mailonline Published: 06:51 EDT, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 07:24 EDT, 13 September 2023 e-mail 3 View comments Dani Dyer looked fresh-faced and stylish as she left the gym after a gruelling session with her friend on Tuesday. The mother-of-three, 27, welcomed twins, Summer and Star , with her partner Jared Bowen almost four months ago and is already back hitting the gym as she completed a personal training session. The former Love Islander cut a sport figure as she donned a pair of teal leggings and a multi-coloured patterned gym top. Leaving the gym, she threw on an oversized denim jacket as she made her way back to her car. The star carried her gym attired in a Nike drawstring bag thrown over her shoulder while her other essentials were in a Louis Vuitton 2,500 bum bag.

The star's blonde locks still looked bouncy as she scraped her hair back in a high ponytail and she donned a pair of square-wide shades. The reality star recently caught up with her fans over on Instagram as she apologised for her absence on social media. Sharing an array of snaps from the past few weeks the star captioned the snaps 'Random photo dump.. I've been so inactive on Instagram.. mum life of 3 is definitely taking over'. Dani shared some adorable snaps of her twin daughters as they donned the same gorgeous dresses, while in another picture the pair looked content as their grandpa Danny Dyer fed them both a bottle of milk. The mother's oldest child, son Santiago, two, who she shares with ex Sammy Kimmence, looked incredibly smart as he beamed in a snap with his sister before posing seriously on his toy Vespa. Last month, Dani opened up about how she and Jarrod have 'adapted' to becoming a family-of-five while also admitting that she is struggling to 'find clothes that currently fit' after welcoming twin girls. Dani answered fans' burning questions in a candid question and answer session on Instagram.

I feel like I'm adapting every single day and not putting too much pressure on myself like I did the first time around. My little Sants taught me so much. 'Trying to find clothes that currently fit me is hard. I preferred having a baby in winter much easier clothing wise. 'I am loving our baby bubble but also looking forward to getting out a bit more as I've really hibernated. So I need to find some sort of a new routine but I know I will get there.' Dani also revealed that Jarrod has been very hands on with the newborns since finishing the football season, but gushed that her mum, Joanne Mas, 'has been her rock'. The mother-of-three said: 'Jarrod has been off which has been amazing, been so lovely having him around as he was away at the start. 'My mum has honestly been my rock especially at the beginning when I couldn't really do much!
