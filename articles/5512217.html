                s star-studded drama is officially , picking up two years after ended. UBAs famous, beloved news anchors, Alex Levy ( ) and Bradley Jackson ( ), have apparently moved up in the worldquite literally in Bradleys case, considering she goes to space for 13 minutes in the premiere. (Yes, you read that right.) The season three opener features Bradley in a rocket along with her boss/friend/potential romantic partner Cory Ellison ( ) and Paul Marks ( ), a tech entrepreneur who is about to upend everyones lives. added Hamm and this time aroundso , at least we can all agree this drama is nabbing the right talent. Meanwhile, the two-part premiere also features Alex, who was meant to go in the rocket, fighting the networks management (whats new?); Bradley pursuing a relevant story about abortion rights in Texas; and UBA getting hacked big time, all while the pandemic and the Ukraine war loom in the background. To help unpack it all, spoke to executive producer and director Mimi Leder about season threes stories, adding comedy into the mix, and why she and the folks who make the show were dead set on casting Hamm in such a pivotal role. Yeah, season three was made as we were coming out of [isolation during] the pandemic. There was a lingering sense of uncertainty about whether we will ever get back to before times. We decided it was important to step forward by two years to find characters somewhat floating and trying to find their footing, trying to find their home and where they belong now. Weve moved past the Mitch Kessler [Steve Carell] story. Weve pivoted away from his sexual misconduct, but his ghost is still in the building. This season, were very much focused on womens autonomy, how its undermined, and the ways [in which] power is being challenged right now. Abortion rights and womens agency is what we were looking to cover. Its a big part of it. Reproductive rights, minority rule, the threat to journalists, the state of the truth ... those are the things happening right now. Were a topical show, so we felt these stories could be interwoven with what our characters have lived through. Whats really interesting about the abortion-rights story Bradley works on: Our executive producer Charlotte Stoudt created it before Roe v. Wade was overturned. It was like life mirroring art and vice versa. That was pretty fascinating. The state of the truth is a big theme for us this year. And look at the world around us, you know? Its mind-boggling. Thats a good question. is always about something without being preachy, and thats important to us. Its why weve attracted the writers who want to join us and its why we were able to get Charlotte Stoudt. But high drama only works through great comedy and when we are entertained. So we wanted to make very entertaining. Even within the dialogue of a scene thats really, really dramatic, all of a sudden youre laughing or smirking. It comes from the writing, acting, and directing. We wanted it to be in the DNA of the show. It was hard to walk that tightrope while making season one, especially the pilot. But weve got great comedic actors who can do anything. It was exciting to step into the directors chair and figure it out over time. With Bradley, when season three begins, we find her seemingly thriving. She has the evening news at UBA, shes got a fabulous new apartment, and shes living her dream as a journalist. But we also see that shes lonely. Shes coming out of the pandemic and shes not with Laura (Juliana Marguiles). Shes also not with Cory. So whats going on? What it has to do with is this huge secret shes carrying. Well look at Bradleys past, why shes a relentless truth-teller, and how it relates to her family and her fathers crimes. And its a very intense story that Reese is incredibly brilliant in. You think the secret between Bradley and Cory is one thing, but its going to turn out to be something else entirely. Yes, we wanted Jon when this character was conceived. It was always Jon Hamm, Jon Hamm, Jon Hamm! [ ] We wrote this tall and handsome character and in walks Jon Hamm. He plays Paul Marks, this innovative genius who is going to save the day at UBA. Then, of course, its about to become more complicated than that. He becomes an accelerant who pushes everyone toward finding the truthour big theme once again. Everyone thinks money is the answer, but theyre about to find out it isnt. He plays an integral role in the power triangle between himself, Cory, and Alex Levy. With Nicole, it happened more organically. We had to find her because Chris Hunter was a difficult character to cast. Shes an Olympic gold medalist who moved into media, a la Michael Strahan. Shes talented and bubbly and the anchor of UBAs morning show. But she comes in and finds out its a bit different than the clarity of the track, where theres a beginning and an end. In the media world, the politics and turf wars at UBA become hard for her to figure out. Theres a power struggle and racism because systemic racism is prevalent in every workplace. So what does winning look like for her now? In navigating this maze, we see that shell find a new side of herself.
