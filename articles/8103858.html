                A woman running for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates is accusing Republicans of committing 'sex crimes' as she claims they leaked videos of her performing sex acts online to derail her campaign. Susanna Gibson is refusing to drop out of the race after she was outed as being an online porn star with her husband  requesting tips for specific acts like anal sex. She is also claiming that it was her Republican rivals who brought to light the existence of the online videos, which were obtained by DailyMail.com, just a few months ahead of election day on November 7. 'My political opponents and their Republican allies have proven they're willing to commit a sex crime to attack me and my family because there's no line they won't cross to silence women when they speak up,' she said. But the newly-unearthed videos show Gibson was anything but scrupulous about her online sexual trysts. Susanna Gibson, a Democrat running for Virginia's House of Delegates, moonlights as an online porn star with her attorney husband, newly unearthed videos reveal Gibson, pictured above with her husband John David Gibson, is running for a highly competitive seat in suburban Richmond. She claims Republicans are to blame for revealing the videos, and accused her GOP rivals of 'sex crimes' The videos were posted to Chaturbate, a platform that says it is named for 'the act of masturbating while chatting online.' Videos on the sight are streamed live without a password, and often archived on other publicly available sites. Under Gibson's username, she had more than a dozen videos archived on another site, Recurbate, in September 2022  after she entered the race. It's not clear when the live streams took place, but her username had 5,770 followers. The videos are no longer active on Recurbate, but can be found on other publicly available sites. Gibson can be seen Katelyn Caralle , Morgan Phillips , By Katelyn Caralle, U.S. Political Reporter Morgan Phillips, U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com
