                Donald Trump has publicly and privately encouraged House Republicans push to impeach President Joe Biden ahead of their potential rematch in 2024, two sources close to the former president said. Trump has kept close tabs on the matter, the sources said  including speaking by phone with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair, about the partys impeachment strategy shortly after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday that he is calling on his committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry into Biden. The former president also had dinner Sunday with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene at his New Jersey golf club, where the two discussed the impeachment inquiry, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN. The inquiry came amid increasing pressure from McCarthys right flank to pursue Bidens impeachment, even as Republicans have yet to prove allegations he directly profited off his sons foreign business deals. Two sources close to Trump insisted that while he had spoken to members about impeachment and kept tabs on House Republicans progress on the matter, he was not intensely focused on it and was not forcing the issue. However, multiple sources said that whether he was forcing the issue or not, the impeachment was inevitably linked to Trump. President Trump has gone on his social media account and said that we should be impeaching President Biden. Kevin McCarthy said we have an impeachment inquiry. You draw the conclusion, Rep. Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican, told CNN. When President Trump speaks, theres a whole a lot of activists that get on board and the activists make their members aware of that. And so directly or indirectly, this impeachment inquiry was a result of President Trumps pressure. He doesnt need to directly tell people what he wants  they know, another source close to the former president said. President Trump isnt sitting in Bedminster or Mar-a-Lago calling the shots in the House of Representatives and telling people like myself or others what to do, Greene told CNN. Not only is he running for president, hes winning the primary. Hes going to be our nominee. And we fully expect him to be our president in January of 2025. And then well be working on a shared agenda moving forward. A source who had spoken recently with the former president said that Trump had been more interested in the Houses ability to defund the Justice Department. After Trumps arraignment in New York in April, he called on Republicans to Congress to defund THE DOJ AND FBI UNTIL THEY COME TO THEIR SENSES, in a post on Truth Social. Trump has also discussed the prospect of having Congress expunge his own two impeachments, an idea McCarthy said he personally backed and would bring it up to the conference to gauge support, as CNN previously reported. One source close to Trump said McCarthy faces more intense pressure from conservatives in Congress  both on Bidens impeachment and on a looming potential federal government shutdown  than he does from Trump. McCarthys existential threat is not Trump. His bigger existential threat is the more hardline members right now on spending an impeachment, the source said. On Tuesday, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump ally, outlined a series of demands, including calling for passage of individual spending bills rather than a short-term stopgap measure to fund the government, as he threatened a push to remove the speaker. Do these things or face a motion to vacate the chair, he said in a speech on the House floor. Other Republicans have cautioned that pursuing Bidens impeachment could backfire on the party, though they supported McCarthys move. Senior House Republican Tom Cole of Oklahoma told reporters Wednesday that impeaching Biden would likely be bad politics but that he believes there is enough that warrants the Houses inquiry. Related Articles I havent seen anybody do too well after an impeachment process. It didnt do well for us in 98 with President Clinton, he said. I dont see it as good politics, I do think though that theres enough stuff here that it deserves to be looked at. And I think the speaker had it right when he said this is the next logical step. Trump has long said he would seek retribution against his opponents if he wins another term in the White House in 2024  a vow he made again at a campaign rally Friday in South Dakota. That means that if I win and somebody wants to run against me, I call my attorney general. I say, listen, indict him. Well, he hasnt done anything wrong that we know of  I dont know, indict him on income tax evasion, youll figure it out, Trump said.
