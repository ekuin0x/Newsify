                Mangosuthu Buthelezi the politically towering Zulu prince unyielding tribal chief and forever combative South African politician who established the IFP an enduring Zulu nationalist formation and moulded it into a formidable political force all the while being its eternal public avatar has passed away His sad passing away was confirmed by his political party and family  both said he died peacefully at his home aged 95 It was no secret that at his advanced age the leader who frowned at being called by his second name Gatsha battled a litany of health issues  although he still cut a subdued figure while continuing with his dual political roles as the traditional prime of the Zulu monarch and avatar of the IFP Buthelezi who had remarkable longevity in all aspects leaves behind a bitterly complicated but still astounding political legacy with some seeing him as a Zulu warlord and zealot and a dictator who was allergic to dissenting voices of any form Despite his many accomplishments during his legion of years in power clearly so he was a divisive figure who was loved and loathed in an equal drove of passion  and there is still plenty of bitterness surrounding his role on the black on black violence issue This was all the while in his rural Zululand where he had a godlike status was revered by his folks and kinsmen as a man who had their best interest at heart For the folks he brought development like establishing teachers colleges hostels for migrant workers in white apartheid managed cities and massive factories which they claim were later destroyed by the ANC government Those who labelled him a warlord claimed that he instigated the black on black violence of the 80s and 90s that pitted the IFP and the ANC aligned UDF leaving over 10 000 people dead some homeless and orphaned in KwaZuluNatal and parts of Gauteng Saddled by these lifelong accusations he used to defend himself by claiming that IFP Inkatha Freedom Party members were acting in selfdefence Yet it would later emerge that the apartheid government used it as a proxy to keep the ANC which was fighting for a majority black rule at bay As a gesture of honour or lifelong dominance in the KwaZuluNatal landscape as some of his critics often claimed his name is up to this moment carried by streets township roads highways schools buildings a university an airport in Ulundi and some townships Buthelezi was first despised by the guardians of the political order of the apartheid era and the early years of democracy as a sellout but was later recognized and respected as an elderly statesman Some in the media space believed he was a difficult character to deal with as he used to retort during interviews instead of answering questions in a decent manner Buthelezi who never battled any corruption scandal during his lifetime was frequently undermined by his unguarded temper He once publicly scuffled with the late Prince Sifiso Zulu live on TV and threatened to sjambok former MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu in front of dignitaries accusing of trying to wipe out his traditional prime minister role He and the IFP the political brand he led for 44 uninterrupted years were inseparable He formed the party at a time when the political arena was being narrowed by the apartheid government Being the only legal political entity in the years of Bantustan governments he moulded the party to be the biggest one in the then homeland of KwaZulu When the country was ushered into democracy in 1994 the party was the third biggest one after the ANC and the nowdefunct National Party the architects and enforcers of dehumanising apartheid laws However the IFP brand would later fade nearly being relegated to oblivion in 2011 when its former national chairperson the late Zanele KaMagwaza Msibi broke away to form the NFP Undeterred the IFP pinned its fortunes on Buthelezi as it started a painstaking rebuilding process Even after he retired in 2019 by handing the party baton to Velenkosini Hlabisa Buthelezi was still the face of the IFP helping it to regain its official opposition status in KwaZuluNatal  among other achievements Two years later after that period of despair and uncertainty for the partys loyalists the ageing Buthelezi was the face of his party when it took part in the local government elections where it surprisingly drubbed the ANC in most KwaZuluNatal municipalities giving it a shock of a lifetime Buthelezi was born on 27 August 1928 in Mahlabathini near Ulundi to a local Buthelezi tribal chief Inkosi Mathole Buthelezi who had 20 and senior Zulu princess who was the 10th wife Magogo kaDinizulu He despised being called Chief as he said the name was used by his ANC detractors to humiliate him and by colonisers to degrade the traditional leadership where the King was once called the Paramount Chief in a futile bid to reserve the title of King for the colonising and unwelcome British royalty From birth he was destined to be a prominent traditional leader and that was due to the fact that her mother was of Zulu royal ancestry As a result after matriculating he was sent to the historic Fort Hare University in the then Cape Colony where he studied In 1948 while studying there he joined the ANC youth league together with the likes of Robert Mugabe and Kenneth Kaunda among other liberation southern African leaders Before he could finish his studies he was expelled for taking part in outlawed political activities of the time He then furthered his studies through the then University of Natal On the advice of Inkosi Albert Luthuli whom he respected so much as his mentor he responded to the call of the Buthelezi Clays elders and returned to Mahlabathini in 1953 to take up his hereditary position as Inkosi tribal chief When the apartheid government started its grand scheme to create Bantustans for blacks within whiteruled South Africa Buthelezi on the basis of him being the traditional prime minister of the Zulu nation was earmarked to lead the KwaZulu one which was for Zulus only Worried about taking the position he consulted with ANC leaders like Luthuli and he was allowed to take the position  but with some conditions like not abandoning the struggle for majority black rule However he was advised to leave the ANC and revive Inkatha Yenkululeko Yesizwe which was tasked with mobilizing along cultural lines as it was done by his uncle and late Zulu King Solomon Dinizulu He agreed to the proposal and served as a chief minister between 1976 and 1994 but a bitter fallout between him and the ANC would later follow immediately after taking over as the head of the KwaZulu bantustan Tired of peaceful resistance the ANC wanted confrontations with the apartheid government and intended to coopt the IFP in this regard Buthelezi would have none of it when it was put to him for implementation After a tense meeting with Tambo and other ANC leaders in London in 1979 the meeting ended in a bitter and defining stalemate Buthelezi came back to SA deeply embittered The 1979 London meeting would prove to be a pivotal point in the relationship between Inkatha and the ANC It became the basis for ANC antiInkatha propaganda In all his discussions with the ANC Mission in Exile Prince Buthelezi was adamant that Inkatha should remain Inkatha and that it should remain committed to the Black popular will which expressed itself in Inkathas massive membership which had doubled in 1977 and again doubled in 1978 Inkatha rightly interpreted this massive increase of membership as a rejection by Black South Africans of the armed struggle After the London meeting for the first time in his career Mr Tambo began criticising Buthelezi and Inkatha publicly He had sided with those in his ranks who saw Inkatha as a threat and who wanted no evidence that black democratic opposition and black nonviolent tactics and strategies were powerful forces for bringing about change IFP official archives recounted the meeting like this Buthelezi and the ANC took separate ways and the hostilities between the ANC and IFP began Apartheid strategists saw an opportunity to ferment a fullblown conflict and ignited what later became to be known as the black on black violence Buthelezi over the years tried to highlight what led to the divorce To prove that the IFP was formed with the blessing of past ANC leaders he repeatedly said the it used ANC colours because it was aligned with the ruling party In August 2019 while putting down some luggage by leaving his longtime IFP leadership position he delivered a long speech at a conference held in the historic Zulu town of Ulundi in northern KwaZuluNatal He tearfully  and once more  recalled the bitter and fatal fallout between the IFP and the ANC Towards the end of that part of the swan song speech choking with emotions he took a deep breath and the marquee went dead silent such that you could hear a pin drop He said he would die happy if there would be reconciliation between the ANC and IFP during his lifetime It is something that must be achieved to normalise the political relationship between our organisations This work now lies in the future This is not just because I am stepping down but because in a few days time I will turn 91 Common sense tells me that my time is short There is so much I will not get to see he tearfully said As an perceived former political skunk who would later become a respected statesman Buthelezi brought stability when the EFF harassed former President Jacob Zuma in parliament He calmed both parties and peace would often prevail Over and over Buthelezi said he was proud of his achievements although his political enemies wanted to erase his legacy by any means necessary  including assassinations He was also an HIVAIDS activist of note as he opposed the government of former President Thabo Mbeki when it was reluctant to roll out lifesaving ARVs When one of his children Princess Mandisa Buthelezi contracted the virus at a time when it was taboo to talk about Buthelezi in an effort to deal with the stigma he openly told the world that the disease claimed the life of his daughter He also publicly revealed in 2004 that his late son Prince Nelisuzulu Benedict Buthelezi succumbed to HIVAIDS as well By doing so he was followed by former President Nelson Mandela whom a year later publicly revealed that his first born son Makgatho succumbed to the then deadly disease Among his high profile friends Buthelezi counted a host of celebrities and politicians like the late Margaret Thatcher the combative former British Prime Minister who was hated for her austerity measures brutality and cold heart leadership Attending her funeral in 2013 British media mistook him for a dapperlooking Ray Charles  turning him into the butt of a joke Locally he counted the Oppenheimers among his friends It was this wealthy Jewish family that he said donated the largesse which saw the establishment of the globally acclaimed Mangosuthu University of Technology in Umlazi south of Durban Buthelezi held the Guinness World Records honour of having delivered the longest legislative speech The speech lasted for two days It started on March 29 1993 when he addressed the KwaZulu bantustan legislature in Ulundi Being a long speech he finished it the following day The departed Buthelezi was the longestserving traditional prime minister of the Zulu monarch and nation He first took the position in 1954 when the late King Cyprian Bhekuzulu appointed him to take over the role which was held by his father Mathole Buthelezi He held the position even under the late King Goodwill Zwelithini and his successor King Misuzulu Moreover Buthelezi was instrumental in the installation of King Goodwill Zwelithini his successor and King Misuzulu through being combative and always determined to get his ways by any means necessary who both faced opposition from some members of the royal family until he stood firm and led their installation  even under protest For the late King Goodwill Zwelithini Buthelezi played even a more significant role during his burial in March 2021 as he led the process with military precision at a time when the socalled Zulu royal rebels were already causing ructions in the royal court His wife Thandekile Irene Mzila from Johannesburg and whom he met while on a trip to the city of gold with one of his royal uncles passed away in March 2019 He is survived by several children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren many of them still live in rural Mahlabathini near Ulundi where they own houses within the big compound email protected IOL Politics
