In the course of a wide-ranging and often quite surreal speech at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin accused Britain of being Perfidious Albion is, we are told, at it again. In the course of a wide-ranging and often quite surreal speech at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin accused Britain of being behind attempted nuclear terrorism, rhetorically asking whether the government was 'trying to provoke us into retaliating against Ukrainian atomic power stations' or whether the British Prime Minister even 'knows what his secret services are doing in Ukraine?' Needless to say, no evidence is forthcoming to support Putin's claims that a number of Ukrainian 'saboteurs' had been intercepted and detailed by Russia's Federal Security Service on their way to break the power lines at an unnamed Russian nuclear power station. He continued that, 'during interrogation, they admitted that they had been trained under the guidance of British instructors.' Even Putin seemed to accept that this might be a hard case to make In case anyone might be a little sceptical, he added that he assured everyone 'that this is the complete, absolute, pure truth.' Of course, as he recognised, 'the possible reaction that they will say everything at gunpoint.' But have confidence because Putin reaffirmed that 'no, that's not true.' Of course, British intelligence has been supporting its Ukrainian counterparts, and leaked US intelligence files claimed that perhaps 50 British special forces were also in-country, presumably Mark Galeotti , Kate Andrews , James Heale , Eugene Finkel , Eliot Wilson , Edward Howell , David Spencer , Tony Letford , Roger Kimball , Ramesh Thakur
