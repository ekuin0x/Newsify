                A China-focused parliamentary researcher working with the ruling Conservative Party was reportedly arrested in March on suspicion of spying for Beijing. LONDON  A parliamentary researcher arrested, two lawmaker candidates withdrawn after security service warnings and a week of anxious whispers about spies in the British corridors of power unlike anything since the Cold War. Only this time the furor is about China, whose alleged espionage to influence governments and target dissidents abroad is gaining growing attention and criticism in the West. The revelations rocking Westminster follow Chinese spying allegations in Canada, Australia and elsewhere, raising questions about America's allies and the balancing act they are trying to play between courting and censuring China. "I have been distinctly concerned about the position of the British government with regard to China and its determination to undermine Western nations," Iain Duncan Smith, a current lawmaker and former leader of the Conservative Party between 2001 and 2003, told NBC News. He and other China hawks see the "potential espionage cell operating in and around Westminster"  as he put it  to be a symptom of a wider malaise: Western countries being too soft on Beijing for fear of hurting their own economies. The China debate simmering in Britain for years exploded last weekend when The Times newspaper reported that a China-focused parliamentary researcher working with lawmakers for the ruling Conservatives had been arrested in March on suspicion of spying for Beijing. London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement that two men had been arrested under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act, legislation relating to espionage, and gathering information "useful to an enemy." As is normal at this stage of any investigation in the United Kingdom, police did not name either person or provide any evidence, only saying one suspect in his 20s was arrested in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the other in his 30s was arrested in Oxfordshire, England. Neither have been Alexander Smith
