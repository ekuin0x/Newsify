                Its been a tough start to the new season for Everton but at least theyre looking down on everyone else in one Premier League table. The Blues secured their first point of the campaign when they drew 2-2 at Sheffield United on September 2 and will be looking for another positive result when they resume action after the international break and host Arsenal on Sunday. defeated the then table-topping Gunners when they last met at Goodison Park on February 4 in inaugural game in charge. Although theyre currently in the bottom three again in the embryonic table, the Blues match-winner that day, , provides an indication of the Premier League table they do top. Research from has calculated that Everton have the tallest team in the Premier League this season with an average height of 185cm or 6ft 1in. The Blues edge out the likes of Nottingham Forest (1.848m); Newcastle United (1.843m) and Liverpool (1.842m) when it comes to having the biggest players while Crystal Palace (1.841m) and Tottenham Hotspur (1.84) arent far behind. At the other end of the spectrum, Brighton & Hove Albion have the shortest team with an average height of 1.808m (approximately 5ft 11in), just behind south coast rivals Bournemouth (1.815m) and Manchester City (1.816) while changing approaches at Sheffield United and Burnley are perhaps implied by them both coming in at 1.817m. The official recorded heights of Evertons starting XI in their last fixture at Bramall Lane were as follows: (185cm); (189cm); (176cm); James Tarkowski (185cm  thats this correspondents height and personally I think he is actually bigger); (196cm); (186cm); (174cm); (192cm); (184cm); (178cm); (194cm). Opposition managers are often commenting how big the Blues are and its a factor that they should try to use to their advantage. As well as the obvious areas such as set-pieces  the delivery and execution still needs to be of quality even if youve got a natural advantage  size should be helping Dyches men to win their individual battles with opponents. Calculations by show that while only Bournemouth with 18.5 (not sure how you can get a half!) can top Evertons defensive duels won so far (18), theyre down in 11th for offensive duels won (31), with the leaders being Tottenham on 48, while the Blues 15 aerial duels won puts them eighth in a category topped by Nottingham Forest (22), so there is still plenty of work to be done.
