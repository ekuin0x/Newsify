                Saoirse Ronan , but she hasnt completely written off the possibility of appearing in a comedy someday hopefully once shes acquired the skill and musicality for the genre, which shes not sure she has yet. That came up in , during which Ronan said that the next thing she wants to try is acting in a comedy because its her favorite genre to watch. I would love to do something modern and funny, she said, and while she doesnt think shes necessarily has the required skills yet, she says shes more comfortable and confident to try. As for the kind of comedy she likes, Ronan apparently specifically named , , and which sets up some exciting possibilities. was a good movie, and Ronan doing some kind of -esque comedy movie definitely seems like something she could do and will do eventually, but maaaan the idea of her doing some kind of thing where she plays herself and has wacky Hollywood/Ireland adventures sounds incredible. Greta Gerwig could show up as a comedically exaggerated version of herself, Ronan could constantly explain to people how her name is pronounced, she could get into absurd misunderstandings that make her look bad even though she didnt really mean to do anything bad, Susie Essman can call her a bald, four-eyed fuck or whatever. You cant deny that it would be very funny to see Ronan doing that exasperated Larry David thing where he just holds his hands up, mid-shrug, because he just cant fathom why someone is mad at him. Someone make this show! Let Saoirse Ronan do whatever she wants!
