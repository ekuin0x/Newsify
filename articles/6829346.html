                Research reveals only three quarters of parents can afford period products for their child when they're menstruating More than one in five (22%) schoolgirls struggle to access basic period protection, according to research. A study of 2,500 parents of girls who menstruate, aged eight to 18, found period poverty is the reality for many, who can't always provide for their children during their time of the month. As many as 34% say their daughter has left for school without the necessary supplies, while 14% have taken the day off to avoid any embarrassment. This equates to 108 hours of missed schooling for each child affected between the ages of 12 and 18. Of those who do make it to school, 19% rely on there being free items such as towels, pads, and tampons available. But 29 % said their child's school is often without period protection. Image: SWNS) SWNS) In addition to towels, pads, and tampons, 21% say they sometimes can't afford to buy toilet roll at home and 44% said their daughters have often reported a lack of loo paper at school. The research was carried out by global hygiene and health company Essity, which is working alongside Tesco and charity In Kind Direct on its hygiene poverty campaign, which will see essential hygiene products, including Bodyform period pads, donated to charities throughout the UK. Spokesperson for Essity, Gareth Lucy said:
