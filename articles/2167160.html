                Self-service checkouts at supermarkets are being blamed by baby boomers and older seniors for increasing loneliness and eradicating one of their last remaining social interactions. When 83-year-old Marliss Myers was widowed, comfort came from her local Albertsons cashier Sharon Hechler. Cashiers like Sarah say they are committed to preserving that special connection with the elderly, despite almost half of checkout lanes in the US now being automated. "We all require that human, personal touch," Sarah told the Los Angeles Times. Cashier numbers are projected to fall by 10 percent by 2031, totaling 335,000 jobs lost, as per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Self-checkouts account for nearly 40% of pay lanes at US grocery chains, according to Catalina Marketing . For all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .

The same poll found two-thirds of Americans said technology has made meaningful connections harder, and almost 70 percent said it has decreased empathy. When Marliss went grocery shopping, Sarah said these fleeting moments of human contact would hugely impact both their days. The spirited cashier, renowned for her signature "toodle-oo" farewell, has been with Albertsons for over 50 years. She said she cherishes the bonds she forms with her customers as much as they do. Since 2014, their relationship has gradually strengthened. When Marliss' husband died just before Christmas 2021, she gave Sarah a copy of his eulogy. "I treasure it," Sarah said. Many experts believe that these types of bonds are vital for mental health as you age. But the shift towards self-service threatens to drive a wedge between shoppers and cashier. Toni Antonucci, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, explained to the Los Angeles Times this week that weak ties  described as warm, low-stakes relationships, like the ones between cashiers and repeat customers  are a critical tool for maintaining emotional well-being.
