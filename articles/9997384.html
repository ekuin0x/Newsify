                Jordan Henderson 'set to start for England against Ukraine' despite expected protests from LGBTQ+ supporters following midfielder's controversial move to Al-Ettifaq Jordan Henderson is expected to start when England face Ukraine on Saturday Protests are expected from LGBTQ+ fans after Henderson joined Al-Ettifaq By Jeorge Bird For Mailonline Published: 06:38 EDT, 9 September 2023 | Updated: 06:49 EDT, 9 September 2023 e-mail 3 View comments Jordan Henderson is set to start for England for the first time since his controversial move to Al-Ettifaq. According to The Telegraph , the former Liverpool captain will be involved from the outset as England continue their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign against Ukraine in Poland on Saturday. Ben Chilwell and Marc Guehi could also start for the Three Lions. Henderson became the highest paid British player in football history when he joined Al-Ettifaq this summer on a £700,000-a-week deal. During his time at Liverpool, Henderson publicly and vocally advocated for LGBTQ + rights. Henderson's move to Al-Ettifaq led to significant criticism from members of the LGBTQ+ community. Jordan Henderson is expected to start when England face Ukraine on Saturday evening Protests are expected from LGBTQ+ fans after Henderson joined Saudi Arabian club Al-Ettifaq Henderson showed support for the LGBTQ+ community during his time as a Liverpool player In Saudi Arabia homosexuality is deemed a crime and is punishable by the death penalty. The Three Lions Pride supporters group are planning a demonstration opposing Henderson's decision to move to Saudi Arabia. Joe White, co-chair of the group, told The Mirror : 'Having spoken to some of our members, there was a real sense of disappointment (after Henderson joined Al-Ettifaq). 'There was a question on whether people were intending to boo, and the original intention was to try to focus on being supportive of the team. 'But if we wanted to make a stand, then turning our backs is quite a symbolic move, particularly given how the community has felt. 'Since his interview, that may well change. I would imagine people are more likely to boo or show an audible distaste. 'There are members attending who we've spoken to and told the position of the group, which is to turn backs. If they want to boo that's a personal decision. 'The issue with booing when you're part of the England fan movement, it could also turn other fans against you who might not know the reasons behind it. England manager Gareth Southgate described Henderson as 'a very experienced professional' 'That was why our position as a group is turning backs. [It] is done in a way that still respects the England team, but makes the point quite clearly that we don't have respect for Jordan anymore.' England boss Gareth Southgate defended Henderson in his pre-match press conference. Southgate said: 'I don't pick the team based on external reaction, but he's a very experienced professional. 'He is very mature at handling any situation. He's trained really well this week. His feeling towards that community hasn't changed. 'I am sure all of our fans are going to get behind the team when the game starts. I am sure they will get behind Jordan when the game starts as well.' Henderson stressed that money wasn't a motivation behind his move to Saudi Arabia. He told The Athletic : 'People will see this club come with loads of money and (say) he's just gone, when in reality that just wasn't the case at all. 'People can believe me or not, but in my life and my career, money has never been a motivation.' Henderson stated that he didn't intend to hurt the LGBTQ+ community. He said: 'I can understand the frustration, I can understand the anger. I get it. All I can say is that I'm sorry they feel like that. My intention was never, ever to hurt anyone. My intention has always been to help causes and communities where I felt like they had asked for my help. 'My values don't change because I'm going to a different country where the laws might be different. I see that as a positive thing. From their (Saudi) side, they knew that before signing it. So they knew my beliefs.' Henderson has made 77 appearances for England since making his debut in 2010.
