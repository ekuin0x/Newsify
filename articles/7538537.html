                A has been put down after repeated and persistent dangerous behaviour towards people on the island. The tagged in the most recent serious incident involving the animal, according to the Queensland environment department. The dingo has demonstrated increasingly significant high-risk behaviours since it was tagged in January 2023, including stealing food, persistently approaching people, stalking, circling, lunging, nipping and biting, the department said in a statement on Monday.

But the animal continued its pattern of negative interactions towards people with a series of threatening and high-risk interactions recorded involving children, adults, and rangers, including six high-risk interactions, the department said. The department said euthanising the dingo was the last resort. In the incident on August 26, the woman fought off the dingo and another with a water bottle. A group of four-wheel drivers came to the aid of the woman, who suffered abrasions on her upper leg. That prompted a warning for people not to walk alone on Kgari and to also carry a stick at all times. A 23-year-old woman was attacked by a pack of four dingoes while jogging near Orchid Beach in July. She was bitten up to 50 times. An eight-year-old boy was also bitten on the buttocks and lower back when he was approached by two dingoes in July. In June, a 10-year-old boy was bitten and dragged underwater while in April, a French tourist was bitten on the buttocks while sunbathing.
