While another protective fan warned Janey: 'Hands off Roger Blondie.' A third shared that they don't believe he fancies Caroline, remarking: 'Saying it again.. Roger is not interested in Caroline.' Another hoped for sparks between the two, noting: 'Roger just said hes into blondes, and there there was Janey on her way. Lets hope shes into him, too!' Meanwhile, Janey, 47, got candid about finding love again on the ITV show during Wednesday's episode of Good Morning Britain , remarking she's been left 'battered' by dating. Janey appeared alongside her son Will, 20, and discussed the joys and sorrows of opening up about dating again. 'I loved it I was like I'm so excited. And then when I walked out I didn't know where I was. It was not a normal circumstance to meet a future husband.' Singer Janey added: 'People were really nice to me, and they were all a bit more mature and kinder. They were very welcoming.' Interested? While he's enjoyed a date with Caroline on the show, some viewers reckon he doesn't have a romantic interest in her and may well have his head turned by Janey, who arrived in the closing moment's of Tuesday's show Excitement: Clearly excited for his prospects following Janey's arrival, fans took to Twitter (now known as X), with one sharing: 'Yes Roger!!' But Janey admitted to be willing to step out of her comfort zone, as she said: 'When you've lived a life and I've bought up William, we've been alone for so long. 'I'm 47 and I feel a bit battered and I think it's fine to put yourself out there now.' Her son Will proved to be fully supportive as he explained: ' I wanted to put her forward, to isolate her dating life, as she mixes it with work normally and aspirations. 'She'll come out a better person.' The new series hit screens on Sunday evening and saw eight single parents enter a West Sussex country house in the hopes of finding their second chance at love. Fans shared their excitement as Janey made a surprise arrival during Tuesday night's show. Closing scenes showed the glamorous blonde as she was driven to the house by her son, Will, 20. Viewers at home hoped that Janey's arrival would 'spice things up' - especially after dad Roger, 58, admitted that he 'prefers blondes.' New experience: Janey appeared alongside her son Will, 20, on GMB and discussed the joys and sorrows of opening up about dating again Getting real: 'I'm 47 and I feel a bit battered and I think it's fine to put yourself out there now,' Janey said during her appearance on Good Morning Britain Newcomer: My Mum, Your Dad fans shared their excitement as singer Janey made a surprise arrival during Tuesday night's show The blonde beauty is singer and recruitment manager who describes herself as 'fun, kind, outgoing and creative'. Janey was nominated to take part on the show by her son Will, who will enter the show alongside his mother and join the kids in the bunker to help his mother to find love. Asked why she thinks her son nominated her, she explained: 'Because he's lost all hope for me, he thinks I'm undateable! He wants me to meet someone.' As for what people will make of her on the programme, she mused: 'I think people might get me wrong at first. 'I'm aware I might be judged on how outgoing I might be, and the fact my job is performing. In reality, I could be the most sensitive person there. And I'm emotional. I'm excited to meet someone that sees that side of me.' Student Will told how he nominated his mother because 'i t's getting a bit desperate now! We need a good chance of getting her to find someone'. He added: ' If it takes me to get involved, then that's apparently how dire things have got!' Describing his mother's perfect partner, he said: 'They'd need to want to dive in the deep end. They need to be confident with me to go and have a day out just the two of us, and to get on with all her friends. Twist: Viewers at home hoped that Janey's arrival would 'spice things up' - especially after dad Roger, 58, admitted that he 'prefers blondes' 'Also someone that's loving in general, and would put her first.' He sweetly told how he wants his mother to find 'comfort and peace of mind' from the dating retreat and admitted she 'needs to be herself more'. When asked how he would describe his mother for her dating profile, he said: 'I'd say an outgoing, chatty lady who is up for a drink!'.

Name: Jess Age: 28 Location: Derbyshire Profession: Network rail planner Why did you nominate your dad to go on the show? It was a joint thing with my brother and sister and it was our way of basically telling him that we were happy for him to start dating, if that was something he wanted to do. It was a cop out on our part really, as it meant we didnt need to sit down and actually say it. It was a sneaky way of saying, Oh look at this, do you want to look into this? Never actually expected anything to come of it. It was about putting dad first. Wed never really thought about us, or about ourselves in that situation. I wasnt thinking about how Id react, I was thinking about him. The reason for that is he does the same for us, he would always put family first. So it was just a way of saying to him, stop worrying about us. If he wasnt ready, that was also totally fine. It wasnt an ultimatum. It was just, if you want to, you can, dont worry about us. Name: Zachary Age: 21 Location: Essex Profession: University student Why did you nominate your dad to go on the show? He deserves a chance to be happy and he hasnt had that. I want him to have what a lot of his friends have done; get married and settle down. He deserves the opportunity to find the end stages of love. Name: Will Age: 19 Location: West Sussex Profession: Student Why did you nominate your mum to go on the show? Its getting a bit desperate now! We need a good chance of getting her to find someone. If it takes me to get involved, then thats apparently how dire things have got! Name: Jessica Age: 23 From: Epsom Profession : Model/ Sales & Marketing/ Mental Health Skills Coaching Why did you nominate your dad to go on the show? I want him to get out there a bit. Hes been focussed on us kids and his work and not even really thought about the possibility of meeting someone new that he could date or have a relationship with. He deserves that and to have someone to do nice things with and have an emotional connection with outside of his kids. Share or comment on this article: Is this the moment Roger finds love?
