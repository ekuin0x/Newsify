                Can we talk Is it just me or is life now a blur of time I dont mean things are going by too quickly I mean were living overlays of time Can we stop it already with fall this and fall that when its still summer Sure we think of Labor Day as end of summer but I know one chief meteorologist rhymes with Zan Darrow who will tell you we have summer right up until September 23 this year Thats when the autumnal equinox arrives It doesnt arrive when Dunkin tells it to just because they want a head start on selling pumpkinflavored this and pumpkinflavored that It doesnt arrive when Halloween decorations are placed on store shelves last week of freaking August And the latest company to implode this quaint concept of one thing at a time Wendys Making its debut on September 12 with about 10 of summer still left before us mind you is their  Wendys describes it as having hints of pumpkin and a blend of warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg for a taste of familiar fall flavors in every bite Oh shut up In another assault on our sense of time theyre also debuting Pumpkin Spice Frosty Cream Cold Brew the same day Why Because they can It was bad enough when retailers depressed every single school kid in the state of New Jersey before the Fourth of July was even here by advertising back to school stuff Bad enough that youll probably be tripping over Christmas trees in Costco by the end of the month Wendys just had to jump on this demonic time machine bandwagon Heres the problem corporate America It cant be summer and fall at the same time What dont you get When you can buy a beach chair a Halloween costume and a Christmas tree on the same day youve got a problem on your hands Its a cult I reject and I wont drink your pumpkin spice KoolAid
