                Pep Guardiola did everything he could to convince Kyle Walker to stay at Manchester City this summer, but ultimately it was his teammates who persuaded the full-back not to join Bayern Munich. Walker had an offer to join Bayern after starting the Champions League final on the bench, but changed his mind after Guardiola and the City squad sprung into action. The 33-year-old signed a new contract on Thursday to stay at City until 2026. Guardiola said that Walker 's performances in pre-season, when he captained the side in their three friendlies, and all but one game after the season started, convinced him of his importance within the group, describing Walker's qualities as a full-back unique in world football. And when his teammates got wind of Walker's offer to join Bayern, Guardiola says they 'demanded' that their leader did not leave, even holding meetings with Walker to plead their case.

"Playing or not playing, Kyle since day one has been really important in our success. Our success belongs to him for the amount of games. "I was so sad not to let him play in the final of the Champions League because with their buildup I thought Manu [Akanji] might help us. But look at the response since then in every pre-season game. Committed with the team. He made me realise how important he is, how he behaves on and off the pitch. "When I spoke with his teammates they told me Kyle could not leave. He's really important in the locker room and he has made a step forward with specific qualities that you cannot find all around the world. "When Bayern Munich call you it is a big, big, big opportunity, there are no doubts about that. When I was 29, 30 years old I wanted to have an experience in another country, always I had that feeling so you have to respect it, but at the same time it was not the end of his contract, like Gundo, he had one or two more years and Bayern Munich have to call. "And in that process we did our job to try to convince him to stay and the benefits to stay, and I promise you, because it was not just me, the club did too but especially it was his mates, they made a lot of meetings saying, Kyle you cannot leave and they made him feel how much he is beloved by everyone and in the end he decided to stay." With captain Ilkay Gundogan leaving over the summer, as well as experienced winger Riyad Mahrez and defender Aymeric Laporte, Guardiola admitted that losing Walker as well would have been a big problem for the dynamics in the changing room, while the club were also pleased to keep Bernardo Silva and pen him down to a new contract. He said: "It would have been a problem. Gundogan, we couldn't retain him, Riyad we lost when we didnt expect it. Losing Bernardo and Kyle would have been a big, big problem. "Its not about substituting the quality  you can find players with similar skills - but there is something in the locker rooms that is so difficult to replace. You need time for that. These guys have experience in important moments, in important games. You know how theyre going to respond in the bad moments to make a step forward. It would have been a big, big loss which is why as a club we fought hard." While Walker will be 36 when his new contract expires - breaking a general contract rule not to offer long-term extensions to older players - Guardiola said that Walker's physicality means that as long as he is settled in his personal life, the club have no concerns over his fitness over the next three years. "His mind is there and he has genetics like few players I have seen with all the conditions," the manager said. "As much as he enjoys his life, it will not be a problem. "Since day one we had a relationship because I know his character is there but he always accepts everything, he always tries to listen and as long as Kyle is focused, settled and his family life is there *puffs out cheeks*, hes incredible, hes an incredible player."
