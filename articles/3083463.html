                JANET STREET-PORTER: Use your brain not your body, Bianca. Why Kanye parading his semi-naked 'wife' through the streets of Italy is the sinister exploitation of a clever woman who really should know better By Janet Street-Porter For Mailonline Published: 17:52, 13 September 2023 | Updated: 18:20, 13 September 2023 e-mail 156 View comments Is this woman a willing participant or a brain-washed love slave? As she mutely totters over the cobbled streets of Florence wearing a strip of bandage across her ample breasts teamed with see-through tights and no underwear, Bianca Censori 's outfits leave NOTHING to the imagination. Day after day, Kanye West 's latest partner has stepped out in fetish-wear revealing not only her nipples, but every crevice of her beautiful body . In a Catholic country like Italy , this is guaranteed to cause outrage in most quarters. But controversy is the drug that West craves in order to thrive. Once a billionaire, with the fashion and music business at his beck and call, his whole empire has been undermined by the man himself. He's become a pariah for his anti-Semitic remarks about Jewish people made in October 2022. And after he handed out White Lives Matter T-shirts and praised Hitler, his business empire lost billions of dollars and his brand became toxic. Put bluntly, Ye needs cash, cash that he has lost through his own mindless rantings. And the way Ye is using his Yeezy brand to dress his new partner Bianca (they allegedly married in LA in January but no sign of a wedding certificate) is very much how he styled his former wife, Kim Kardashian - but she finally managed to escape his controlling regime, divorcing the father of her four children last autumn. The two women look eerily similar. Bianca looks like Kim before she fought back and created her own style. As she mutely totters over the cobbled streets of Florence wearing a strip of bandage across her ample breasts teamed with see-through tights and no underwear, Bianca Censori 's outfits leave NOTHING to the imagination I very much doubt that Bianca has chosen her wacky outfits, because Kanye - or Ye as he likes to be known these days - is well-known as the ultimate control freak, who decided exactly what his former wife Kim Kardasian should wear in public, and in the process she became the most photographed woman in the world I very much doubt that Bianca has chosen her wacky outfits, because Kanye - or Ye as he likes to be known these days - is well-known as the ultimate control freak, who decided exactly what his former wife Kim Kardasian should wear in public, and in the process she became the most photographed woman in the world. Since he arrived in Italy at the end of July with Bianca, the most controversial musician in the world has been stepping out with a bag over his head, or a mask covering his face. He's worn a German police T-shirt with huge shoulder pads, no underwear and socks instead of shoes. He's in head-to-foot black so nothing detracts from his 'muse'. READ MORE: Kanye West's 'wife' Bianca Censori showcases her cleavage in yet ANOTHER daring look as the couple step out in Florence amid their scandalous getaway <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/debate/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement It's well known that Italians adore and admire glamorous women - but now even they are begging Ms Censori and her 'husband' to put some clothes back on, accusing them of a lack of respect after they were filmed engaging in what looked like intimate sexual activity on a water taxi in Venice on August 28th. On that occasion, Bianca's head was buried in Ye's lap, while he had his trousers pulled down, revealing his bare backside. Since then, Bianca has had all her 'bits' on display every day. It's a one-note advert for Yeezy clothing and shapewear. But what lies behind this rancid display? Before his divorce from Kim at the end of 2022, the last couple of years had been difficult for Ye. He has had meltdowns, been hospitalized, and struggled with his mental health. His former wife has spoken on social media about his bipolar diagnosis, asking for sympathy and understanding. Kim says Ye is 'brilliant but complicated'. In spite of Ye's undoubted genius as a musician, his credibility has been undermined by off-stage rantings. In 2016, his tour was cut short and he was hospitalized suffering from depression and paranoia. In 2018, he caused outrage by stating that slavery 'was a choice'. In July 2020, he announced he planned to run for the US Presidency, and no longer supported Donald Trump. He's got a track record of crashing onstage at industry events coming out with gems like 'if I don't win, award shows lose credibility'. No shortage of ego here. He's even set up his own church in California, holding services every Sunday - when he's not parading around Venice without his pants on. But in October 2022, Ye made the biggest mistake of his career when he ranted about 'JEWISH PEOPLE' in a slur I will not repeat. And then handed out WHITE LIVES MATTER T-shirts during Paris fashion week. He went on to praise Hitler in an interview with a conspiracy theorist and said he didn't believe in the term antisemitism. As a result Ye was dropped by Balenciaga, Gap, Adidas, all the fashion labels who collaborated with and boosted his own brand Yeezy. So Bianca's horribly vulgar outfits - pure Yeezy - are designed to be photographed and get his brand mentioned all around the world. But this strategy could be backfiring. Online, critics are sneering at the couple's crudity and on the streets of Florence, there has been cat-calling and sniggers. The couple might be trying to look edgy, but the result is more like a scene from a bad sci-fi movie from the 1960s. As for Bianca, this is no dumb blonde. She studied architecture at University in Melbourne, and completed a Masters degree. Always a body-conscious dresser, how has this brainy Australian female been turned into a miserable looking robot? At the start of their relationship, she might have been seduced by the undisputed charisma of Ye at his best. But she's been turned into nothing more than a shop window dummy for his trashy wares. Kanye was seen covering up in an all-black ensemble which consisted of a short-sleeved, black shirt as well as black trousers He additionally wore a black hood that covered most of his face and slung a black, cross-body bag over his shoulder during the pair's shopping trip And given her qualifications, is this really a dignified and rewarding way to spend her time? Kanye West originally made his fortune creating brilliant music but his last album Donda 2 (named after his late mother) was only released on Stem - a streaming device he helped develop - so if you wanted to listen to the whole album, you had to spend twice. Critics described the album as 'crudely unfinished'. Kano, the company that developed the stem player, has now cut ties him. This summer, Ye appeared on stage for the first time since last year's controversy, in Rome. It's said he has been recording tons of new songs and an album, provisionally entitled Man Across the Sea, is ready any day now. Which adds to my theory that Bianca is nothing more than a marketing accessory, a publicity stunt, a willing performer in his freak show. It's not fashion as we know it, but clever PR. What's hard to understand is why a smart woman has let herself be used like this. Kim Kardashian has been accused of many things, but no one would ever say she is stupid. She's training to be a lawyer and fights for those on death row. Ye is undoubtedly attracted to brains. The mystery is why Bianca Censori was willing to hand over her individuality and her own personality to one of rap music's biggest showmen in order to push his career. She is a victim of his personality cult. Let's hope she escapes. Share or comment on this article: JANET STREET-PORTER: Use your brain not your body, Bianca.
