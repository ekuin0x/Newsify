Leadership in the Age of Personalization Following Sep 13, 2023, 08:45am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Personal resilience is an important skill to cultivate in the workplace and is as a crucial first ... [+] step towards building individual strength and fostering resilience within organizations. Shutterstock Labor strikes to protect careers from being taken over by AI. Uncertainty about inflation. Fires in Maui and tropical storms in Los Angeles. In an era of rapid technological advancement, unpredictable financial markets, and the impacts of climate change, threats to our industries, organizations, and personal lives are more present than ever. These threats breed uncertainty, raising questions about the survival of companies, job security, the relevance of our skills, and the stability of our future. The key to navigating these uncertainties lies in resilience and reinvention. These are more than just buzzwords. Resilience is our ability to adapt and thrive amidst change and volatility, while reinvention is our capacity to transform ourselves or our organizations in response to these changes. Its not the threats themselves that make us vulnerableits our inability to demonstrate resilience and reinvent when they arise. But heres another central truth: your organization is only as resilient as the least-resilient individual in your workforce. Your most-resilient individual is only as resilient as the organization will let them be. Making an organization resilient requires that individual employees have resilient traits, and also that the organizational systems make room for those traits to exist. This is the first in a series of five articles about resilience and our readiness for reinvention, and how we can pursue them at the levels of the individual, the team, the operating unit, the organization and the industry. MORE FOR YOU Nocturnal Predators: How Ukraines 47th Brigade Fights In Its Leopard 2A6 Tanks Ukraines Stabilized Turrets Are Why Its Improvised Fighting Vehicles Arent Terrible 2024 Ford F-150 Gets 90% Fewer Permutations, More Hybrid Availability The 2023 Career Optimism Index , published by the University of Phoenix Career Institute, found that despite the challenges of the past year, 80% of Americans remain hopeful about the future of their careers. However, their hope is grounded in their own sense of personal efficacy, not in their current employers. According to the study, this has led to a free agent labor market where the workforce is willing to pursue alternative job opportunities unless employers invest in foundational career support over transactional perks. More highlights from the study: 53% of Americans are actively looking for a new job or expect to in the next 6 months. Among those looking for a job or expecting to look for a job in the next six months, 68% said they would consider staying at their job if things could change. 70% of American workers say if their company gave them more opportunities to apply new skills, they would be more likely to stay throughout their career. Thats good news: people want to be resilient and they want to be able to reinvent themselves. Sometimes they just dont know how, or they dont feel like their boss or their organization will give them the room to grow in this way. This is a huge opportunity for employers to invest in people  and its an investment that would pay dividends for the employees and the organization. Building Individual Resilience Through 4 Essential Questions This infographic explores the 4 key elements of building self-resilience through personal branding. ... [+] Personal resilience is the initial foundation for developing individual strength and cultivating resilience within an organizational context. Paulo Silvano, GLLG. Understanding ones own strengths and unique capabilities plays a crucial role in building self-resilience. These questions help individuals gain deeper understanding of what makes them unique in the way they think, the skills they bring to a situation, the experience they create for fellow team members, and the particular solutions they can offer. Leaders, go through this thought process for yourself, and also give those you lead the opportunity to explore these questions for themselves. Some people might be able to answer these right away, but most people benefit from a facilitated process that helps them dig deep to uncover answers and learn things about their abilities and their presence that might surprise them. What is your Enduring Idea? This is about discovering your unique thought process and the long-term influence you can exert. It involves introspection to identify core values and beliefs, which act as anchors in times of change, fostering resilience. What is your Primary Differentiator? This focuses on what sets you apart in a dynamic professional environment. Emphasizing unique skills and experiences enables you to adapt and stand out amidst shifting trends, enhancing resilience. Within your team, what are the skills that make you unique? Also, among others who have the same skills, what is it about you that differs from the rest? What is your Primary Experience? This refers to understanding the impact others expect from your presence. How do people feel after theyve been in your presence or on a team with you? Do they feel inspired? Understood? Lifted up? Whether you know it or not, theres an experience you deliver. If you dont know what it is or who to ask for feedback, start by asking yourself: What do I want people to experience while working with me? Being intentional empowers you to navigate professional relationships flexibly, contributing to relevance and resilience. What do you Solve For? This involves identifying the problems youre most intrigued by and/or best suited to solve. Focusing on areas where you can make the greatest impact encourages continuous learning and problem-solving skill development, fostering adaptability and resilience. To put this into context, heres a hypothetical example. Stephanie is a graphic designer. Heres how she answers the questions: Enduring Idea : Everything can be easy to understand through artful visuals (Artful Visualization). Primary Differentiator : Stephanie is artistic but also educated in industrial design and systems thinking, bringing a unique combination of skills to each project. She can see the whole picture and put complex ideas into context that make them easy to grasp (Holistic & Contextual). Primary Experience : People are amazed and grateful when she takes their complicated system and communicates it clearly and artfully through visuals that simplify what they thought was too complicated to communicate (Clarifying). What does Stephanie solve for? She helps highly technical people connect with non-technical audiences (Connects Disconnected Parts). Stephanies identity and skills are useful and in demand well beyond her role in graphic design. She could put those skills to use in a variety of contexts, teams, organizations and industries. Personal Resilience is a Crucial First Step Knowing your strengths and your identity allows you to leverage them in challenging situations. This is a holistic view of what someone adds to any project or team. This proactive approach to self-improvement can boost resilience at the individual level. But it also is a crucial starting point for building resilience at the levels of our teams, our units and our organizations as a whole. Think of this as the first building block: once we know this about ourselves and about each other, we can build better systems for enabling individual capacities to be elevated and activated throughout organizations. This is simply a starting point. In the next article of the series, well expand our view to address resilience a the team level.
