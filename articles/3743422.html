                Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the mega plantation drive of the Government of Assam while stating that apart from providing long-term benefits of environmental protection and improving the health of the people, it will also boost the country's mission for clean and green growth. He added that this exercise of the state government will also enhance the green cover of the place. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday shared a letter from the Prime Minister on the 'Amrit Bhrikshya Andolan' in which PM Modi wrote, "The idea of planting one crore saplings across Assam is admirable and laudable." Sarma while sharing the letter on X (formerly known as Twitter) wrote, "It is always blissful Hon PM Shri Narendra Modi Ji to get your guidance and generous blessings in our novel endeavours. Our Amrit Brikshya Andolan has been inspired by your vision, and dedication to a clean, green and sustainable future. We commit to relentlessly pursue your vision of samanvay of Prakriti and Pragati and make it part of our Sanskriti. Honoured Sir by your encouraging words." It is always blissful Hon PM Shri @narendramodi Ji to get your guidance and generous blessings in our novel endeavours. Our Amrit Brikshya Andolan has been inspired by your vision, and dedication to a clean, green and sustainable future.

He then quoted a couple of Sanskrit lines on how trees purify the air and help in driving the diseases away. PM Modi said that bringing 'Prakriti' and 'Pragati' together has been the hallmark of the development model of 'New India'. The letter further read, "While we have been the fastest growing economy, we have also been perhaps the only major nation to meet committed climate targets." He then talked about initiatives like this plantation drive and said, "It will also lead to several long-term spin-off benefits for environment protection and in improving the health of people." PM Modi then talked about how rich Assam is in terms of its biodiversity and diverse ecosystem and said, "The plantation of saplings on private and community-owned lands will go a long way in enhancing the green cover in the scenic state." As per PM Modi's letter, the involvement of the local communities in the plantation drive will "foster the spirit of 'Jan Bhagidari' (people's participation) and bring a sense of ownership and environmental stewardship among the people." The Government of Assam has undertaken a drive to plant one crore saplings across the state during which it aims to create nine world records in various segments related to the exercise, reported news agency PTI.
