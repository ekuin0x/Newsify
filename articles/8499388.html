After the humiliation of losing a penalty style shoot out to the German defence minister on live TV, he arrived with his bodyguard to watch the finals of a power lifting contest. Wearing a black Invictus polo shirt Harry could be seen greeting fans and cheering on contestants in the finals of the powerlifting and the wheelchair rugby, one of the most popular sports at the games. Moments before he was spotted looking out of the Merkur Spiel arena from between the red sliding doors of an executive box.

Jane, from Liverpool, was full of praise for the Prince and his support for injured and disabled servicemen. She said: 'He asked us how long we planning to stay and was such a nice man. He said hello to Finley, just saying 'I am Harry'. He is just a lovely, lovely man.' Harry briefly left the wheelchair rugby but returned to watch the Italy v South Korea match where he shook hands with the mascot of the French team  a giant rooster. While appearing on the TV show 'Sport Studio' she said he planned to watch as many events as possible and catch up with competitors he had previously met at the games.

Wearing a white shirt and smart trousers, Harry looked sombre on Friday as he left a side entrance of St George's Chapel as family, Britain and the world again mourned the Queen's passing. It is not known if he went to Her Majesty's grave in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, which sits within the walls of the church. Harry was seen by the public leaving the church where his grandparents are both buried at around Midday. An executive Range Rover was waiting for him with his bodyguard waiting to open the door. A number of members of the Royal Family are understood to have visited the chapel yesterday. Harry remains close to his cousins Beatrice and Eugenie but it is not yet known if they and others paid their respects together. MailOnline has asked Buckingham Palace and a spokesman for the Duke of Sussex to comment. The warring brothers are spending the first anniversary of their grandmother's death in the same country  but still couldn't be farther apart and did not meet before Harry jetted off to Germany last night. Harry is believed to have gone straight from the church where he married Meghan Markle in 2018 to Heathrow to catch a British Airways flight to Dsseldorf, where he is pictured Harry is driven into the Hyatt Regency hotel in Dusseldorf on Friday after his quick trip to Britain READ MORE: William and Kate at St Davids Cathedral to remember the late Queen <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> Advertisement The Duke of Sussex was at his personable best in London on Thursday as he met winners of the WellChild Awards  a charity he has been patron of for 15 years and stayed with after his acrimonious departure from the Royal Family. Harry flew in for the engagement from his home in California, making his first appearance in the UK since June. But despite the long flight, the duke cut a relaxed figure as he sat with the youngsters and their families during a pre-ceremony reception at The Hurlingham Club in south-west London. It was as Harry prepared for the awards this time last year that news began filtering through that his grandmother was seriously ill before passing away hours later. The duke took a flight to Scotland but landed too late to see the Queen before she passed away. 'As you know, I was unable to attend the awards last year as my grandmother passed away,' he told the audience. 'As you also probably know, she would have been the first person to insist that I still come to be with you all instead of going to her. And that's precisely why I know, exactly one year on, she is looking down on all of us tonight, happy we're together continuing to spotlight such an incredible community.'
