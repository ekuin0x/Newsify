                Shah Rukh Khan's is receiving much love and appreciation from the masses across the country and worldwide as well. The film has collected Rs. 369 crore at the domestic box office. SRK playing a double role has made the audience crazy, and they are loving both the avatars of the actor on the screen. The actor has several looks in the film, and one of them is his bald look. In a recent interaction, SRK opened up about the bald look in the film. He revealed that he opted for that out of laziness and nothing else. He said, "It was never part of the script. It was a part of the get-up that was a part of the script." He added, "I just chose the bald look out of laziness." The actor added, "I said, Yeah, then I dont have to wear 2 hours of this makeup; can I just go bald?'" The actor added that he had reservations as he had shown the promo to some of his friends, and they told him that it looked scary and girls wouldn't like you. He said, "So I hope girls like me. I hope girls like bald men. I like bald girls." SRK's marked the debut of filmmaker Atlee, actress Nayanthara, and singer-composer Anirudh in Bollywood. Apart from SRK and Nayanthara, the film stars Vijay Sethupathi, Deepika Padukone, Sunil Grover, Sanya Malhotra, Priyamani, Eijaz Khan, Lehar Khan, and others. The film was released in theatres on September 7, 2023.
