                The latest episode sees reunite with her old Master Anakin Skywalker in the  and Skyguy has plenty left to teach her, putting his former apprentice through her paces until she emerges a changed person, . One of the ways Anakin tries to get his message across is via a trip back in time to a Clone Wars era battle. Ahsoka, now much younger  and  remarks that this is one of her and Anakin's first missions, which puts the moment in The Clone Wars season 1. Some fans, though, have pinpointed the exact episodes, which cover the Battle of Ryloth (season 1, episodes 19-21). The biggest clue that this is correct is the presence of Twi'leks in the background of Ahsoka episode 5. This arc of the Clone Wars saw the Twi'lek home planet fighting for liberation from the Separatists  in fact, 's father, Cham Syndulla, is a major character in this storyline. Significantly, one Clone Wars episode in particular has strong links with the Ahsoka flashback. In 'Storm Over Ryloth,' Ahsoka disobeys orders and accidentally leads her men directly into a trap, resulting in heavy losses. Anakin then gives her a speech about the reality of war, which parallels Ahsoka's concerns with the injured clones and being trained to be a soldier in the episode 5 flashback. In The Clone Wars episode, Anakin then pulls off a pretty risky plan that relies on Ahsoka to save his life, restoring her faith in herself  another mirror of Anakin forcing Ahsoka to fight for her own life in the live-action series. 'Storm Over Ryloth' doesn't actually see on the planet's ground, though, so the live-action moment isn't from this episode. But, the parallels between the two shows reveal why this is the battle Anakin decided to transport Snips back to for his lesson to be most effective. Ahsoka continues weekly on .
