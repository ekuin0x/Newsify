                Tom Curry's red card in the opening few minutes of the England v Argentina match has sparked a huge debate across the rugby world<br>-  Curry was given his marching orders after his yellow card for a head-on-head hit on Argentina full-back Juan Cruz Mallia was upgraded to red by the TMO bunker system<br>-  The decision has seen a number of former professionals rage against the way rugby is going in its efforts to increase player welfare<br>-  Many thought there was little Curry could do to avoid the collision, but others deemed it the correct call, citing Curry's height entering the challenge and failure to make any attempt to lower his body before impact<br>-  ITV pundits Lawrence Dallaglio and Sir Clive Woodward thought it the wrong decision, with the former describing it as "harsh"<br>-  Woodward, writing in his MailOnline column , added: "It was just an accident<br>-  Curry's head-on-head contact with Juan Cruz Mallia was what I call a 'rugby incident<br>- ' "The sport is in trouble in my opinion if those sorts of collisions are deemed worthy of a sending off<br>-  Whether or not there is intent in a player's actions should not and does not impact a referee's decision<br>-  I understand that<br>-  "But I really do not know what Curry was supposed to do to not get into that position<br>- " What did you make of the decision? Comment below Former Wales international Andrew Coombs disagreed, saying on social media: "Dallaglio and Woodward proving they are stuck in a different era with their half time analysis of the Tom Curry red card<br>-  "I really feel for Curry but where player welfare comes first, the incident warranted a red card<br>-  No malice in the tackle, just has to get lower! Former England fly-half Freddie Burns was angered by the decision though<br>-  Winds me right up<br>-  Curry no real intent, cant let the guy run through him, red<br>-  Carreras opportunity not the flatten Ford but decides to do it anyways, yellow<br>-  Im know Im English and slightly bias, but I dont understand it<br>-  Both yellows for me, he posted after the review bunker did not upgrade Santiago Carreras yellow card<br>-  Ex-England winger Chris Ashton says Curry shouldn't have taken the risk, adding on BBC Radio: "Because Juan Cruz Mallia is coming down from so high, he has tried to time it perfectly<br>-  He is running the risk and it is a fine line these days<br>-  "The game has changed and it is not worth the risk in order to time a perfect hit, when you can just let the player hit the floor and hit him lower<br>- " "He is like a caged animal," Matt Dawson said of Curry on BBC Radio 5 Live<br>-  "It is a common theme the ill-discipline of England<br>-  They get in such a good position and they mean well but the presence of mind and the split-decision thinking is missing<br>- " Many fans took to social media to share their views, with the decision to send off Curry described as "outrageous" and "unbelievable" by some, while others insisted the letter of the law had been followed and Curry could have done more to avoid the incident<br>-  Join the Wales Rugby breaking news and top stories WhatsApp community The new Wales Rugby breaking news and top stories WhatsApp community has launched<br>-  You can expect the day's top stories and major updates sent directly to your WhatsApp from our team - allowing you to stay up to date with all the latest Welsh rugby news for free<br>-  The next few months are the biggest in rugby for four years as Warren Gatland's team prepare for and then head to the Rugby World Cup<br>-  We'll be with you every step of the way, keeping our community of readers and fans in the loop with the stories that matter<br>-  All you have to do to join is click on this link, select 'Join Community' and you're in<br>-  No one else in the community will be able to see your personal information and you will only receive messages from the WalesOnline sport team<br>-  We will not spam your WhatsApp feed with constant messages, but you will receive updates from us daily<br>-  We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners<br>-  If for some reason you decide you no longer want to be in our community, you can leave by clicking on the name at the top of your screen and clicking 'Exit Group'<br>-  You can read our Privacy Notice here<br>-  JOIN OUR WHATSAPP COMMUNITY HERE
