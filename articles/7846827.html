                The preferred site for a 100 million East Midlands innovation park has been revealed, which could become a hub for UK tech companies within a couple of years. The new Automated Distribution and Manufacturing Centre (ADMC) looks set to be built on land near Sutton-in-Ashfield railway station, a couple of from junction 28 of the M1 in north Nottinghamshire. The location has been picked due to the available space and transport links and its proximity to Vision West Notts College technology campus and other nearby industrial sites. Ashfield District Council has agreed in buy the land from Nottinghamshire County Council and work could start next year. Funding will come from the councils Towns Fund Deal, as a part of the investment to create nationally and internationally recognised centres, mirroring UKs existing Catapult Centres. It would include a 30 million innovation centre with about 43,000 sq ft of space available for companies to carry out R&D, new product testing, skills development, showcasing and collaboration. It would also have technical experts, engineers and researchers based there to help the regions businesses get to grips with new technologies and train their staff for higher skilled jobs. The council said the site is well placed to support the high number of distribution companies in the region and the new East Midlands Freeport. Ashfield District Council growth, regeneration and planning spokesman Councillor Matthew Relf said it would boost economic growth and new investment opportunities and create well paid jobs. He said: These projects are central to achieving the Councils ambition of making Ashfield a great place to live, work, study, play and visit.
