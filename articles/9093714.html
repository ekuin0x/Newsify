                Cowboys' Dak Prescott is seen embracing rumored girlfriend - 'a 29-year-old Moet Hennessy employee' - after his 40-0 blowout win over Giants Prescott is rumored to be dating Sarah Jane Ramos, who is now a Cowboys fan An earlier post suggested she was attending Monday's game in East Rutherford DailyMail.com provides all the latest international sports news By Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter Published: 16:28, 15 September 2023 | Updated: 16:56, 15 September 2023 e-mail View comments Dak Prescott's personal life got a little more public this week as the Dallas Cowboys quarterback was pictured alongside his rumored love interest in an Instagram post. Identified by Outkick as Prescott's girlfriend, 29-year-old Sarah Jane Ramos works as a specialist for Moet Hennessy. Following the Cowboys' 40-0 pounding of the rival New York Giants , Ramos pictured herself on Instagram alongside Prescott, who had his arm around the smiling brunette. She is pictured wearing a Cowboys jacket in the photo. An earlier post suggested she was attending the game in East Rutherford, New Jersey , showing her team apparel with a caption reading: 'Go Cowboys.' Various reports have claimed that Prescott was in a two-year relationship with Natalie Buffett, but the pair split in January. He was also romantically linked to LSU swimmer Jadyn Jannasch. Cowboys QB Dak Prescott (left) is rumored to be dating Sarah Jane Ramos (right) An earlier post suggested she was attending the game in East Rutherford on Monday night The 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, the 30-year-old Prescott is a two-time Pro Bowl selection who signed a four-year extension worth $160 million with the Cowboys back in 2021. Now Prescott is tasked with making sure the Cowboys (1-0) don't have a letdown in their home opener Sunday against Zach Wilson, who helped the New York Jets (1-0) persevere in an overtime win over Buffalo. 'Obviously I wanted to play against the guy,' said Prescott, who lost a wild-card game against Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay after leading the Cowboys to the top seed in the NFC as a rookie in 2016. Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles tear on Monday. 'But to say it diminishes an NFL game would be wild of me, especially understanding how great this defense is,' said Prescott, whose 2020 season ended in Week 5 with a gruesome ankle injury. 'Watch the way that they won that game the other night. They've got our respect and haven't lost any bit of that.' Prescott had only 143 passing yards against the Giants, but the Cowboys still won, 40-0 Sarah Jane Ramos is seen at a golf course in a picture she posted on her Instagram profile Both teams opened at MetLife Stadium, the Cowboys routing their NFC East rivals, the Giants, 40-0 a night before Rodgers went down on New York's fourth offensive play against the Bills. Wilson rallied from an interception with a touchdown pass, and the Jets won 22-16 on Xavier Gipson's punt return in overtime. The Cowboys started their season by returning a blocked field goal for a score. Now New York faces the reality of diminished Super Bowl expectations in a season without Rodgers, while looking for the franchise's first 2-0 start in eight years. 'As unfortunate as it is, you can't dwell on it,' Jets center Connor McGovern said. 'Sure, everyone is saying whatever theyre saying, but we're not believing it. We know we're ready to roll, we have an incredibly talented team, we have all the talent to make the run - same run we talked about at the beginning.'
