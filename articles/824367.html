                Michael Beale and Rangers picked up a much-needed win as they look to get a run of results together. The suffered a week to forget pre-international break with a e exit at the hands of PSV after a hammering in Eindhoven before and arrived at Ibrox to claim the derby day spoils in the first meeting of the season in front of a full house of home fans after winner. It's been a tough two weeks for Beale and his players with plenty of questions asked of both his summer recruits and his future with the gaffer admitting in the build-up to this one with St Johnstone that he . He reacted by making SIX changes to his starting team and was rewarded just 15 minutes in as scored a brilliant header - but was forced off with a nasty head knock in the move after a collision with Liam Gordon. Rabbi Matondo then made sure of the win after racing through and slotting home from Tom Lawrence's lovely pass. Kemar Roofe also had the ball in the net but it was ruled out. Here's three things we learned. Michael Beale made SIX changes to his Rangers side for their visit to McDiarmid Park. The Ibrox gaffer has suffered the flak from Champions League elimination and defeat to Celtic at Ibrox pre-international break with the supporters demanding results and for the new look team to start putting performances together. Ben Davies, Ridvan Yilmaz, John Lundstram, Tom Lawrence, Sam Lammers and Danilo all came into the side from the one that started that defeat to Brendan Rodgers' side with Todd Cantwell ruled out injured. It was a move that paid off as Danilo - who was unfortunately forced off with a horror head knock in the same move - headed the away side into the lead after an excellent James Tavernier cross. Lawrence then set up substitute Rabbi Matondo for the all important second goal. This game is the first of SEVEN in the space of 22 days ticked off. Rangers will compete in three competitions in that period between the Scottish Premiership, Europa League and Viaplay Cup. Real Betis come calling to Ibrox next week as the group top seeds bid to get up and running in their quest to secure knockout round football after Christmas in a competition that has been very good to them in recent years. Holders Celtic are out of the League Cup and it presents a big chance for the Ibrox men to put silverware in the trophy room in the first competition up for grabs. Livingston stand between them and a day out at Hampden in the last four. Following today's away clash at McDiarmid Park it is FOUR home games on the bounce that could prove key to get form and confidence back into the side and in the stands. A first start in just over 13 months for Tom Lawrence and it is like a new signing for the club. Signed by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, the former Derby County man made an excellent start to life at Ibrox before that horror injury. It's been a long road back but he's now fit and raring to go and was in from the start here with Todd Cantwell out injured. A real chance to put his stamp on the team and secure a permanent return to the starting XI. Loves to get on the ball and thread passes and notched a stunning assist for Rabbi Matondo's strike. Overall excellent.
